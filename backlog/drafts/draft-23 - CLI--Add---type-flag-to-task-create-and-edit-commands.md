## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Extend CLI commands to support the type field, allowing users to specify and modify task types from the command line.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 task create command accepts --type flag with autocomplete for configured types
- [x] #2 task edit command accepts --type flag to modify existing task type
- [x] #3 task list output displays type field (abbreviated in table view)
- [x] #4 task view (plain mode) includes type in output
- [x] #5 Invalid type values produce clear error message listing valid options
- [x] #6 CLI help text documents the --type flag
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Centralize configured task-type values, case-insensitive canonicalization, and valid-value formatting in one shared utility; reuse it from Core and CLI surfaces.
2. Add --type to task create/edit, pass values through Core validation, and add configured type selection with an explicit untyped option to the shared Clack create/edit wizard.
3. Add configured task-type shell completion and dynamic help schema/examples sourced from the project config.
4. Expose types through read-only config get/list, without adding a config set surface.
5. Show [type] in plain task-list rows when present while preserving omission for untyped tasks; retain the existing Type line in plain detail output.
6. Add focused utility, wizard, completion, config, help, and CLI integration tests, then run targeted tests, typecheck, Biome, build, and the full suite.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented one shared task-type configuration resolver and reused it from Core, dynamic CLI help, shell completion, and the Clack create/edit wizard. CLI create/edit now accept --type with configured-value canonicalization; edit and the wizard can clear the value; untyped tasks remain untyped. Plain task lists show a compact [type] badge, while shared plain details show Type only when present. config get types and config list expose configured/default values; config set remains unsupported.

Validation: 47 focused tests passed; bunx tsc --noEmit passed; bun run check . passed across 311 files; bun run build passed; full bun test passed 1496 with 2 documented interactive TUI skips and 0 failures; compiled dist/backlog create/edit/list/config/help smoke passed.

Independent review follow-up: plain task-list rows now share one formatter, so --sort priority preserves the same priority and type badges as grouped plain output. Create/edit help examples now quote the first configured task type instead of hard-coding default values; custom Bug/Epic projects advertise only valid commands.

Review-fix validation: 35 focused tests passed; bunx tsc --noEmit passed; bun run check . passed across 311 files; bun run build passed; full bun test passed 1496 with 2 documented interactive TUI skips and 0 failures.

Exact-head simplicity cleanup: removed the unused exported resolveTaskTypeValues helper and its future-only unit test. BACK-355.04 will introduce the plural resolver together with its production list/search caller. Existing singular resolution, validation, help, completion, and output behavior is unchanged.

Cleanup validation: rg confirms no resolveTaskTypeValues references remain; 19 directly affected tests passed; bunx tsc --noEmit passed; bun run check . passed across 311 files; bun run build passed. A full 1496-test run had already passed on the immediately preceding head; this removal had no production caller, so the full suite was not repeated.

Final scope cleanup: reduced taskType to its parameterless single-value help contract and removed completion support for undeclared --task-type. BACK-355.04 will add plural schema wording and task-type completion with the filtering commands that consume them. Current create/edit help and context-gated --type completion behavior is unchanged.

Final cleanup validation: no multiple taskType call or task-type completion branch remains; 21 affected tests passed; bunx tsc --noEmit passed; bun run check . passed across 311 files; bun run build passed. Full suite was not repeated because this exact diff only deletes unreachable future hooks and the immediately preceding functional head passed 1496 tests with 0 failures.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Added canonical CLI task-type support across create/edit flags, interactive selection, configured casing and validation, shell completion, help, read-only config output, and plain human-readable task output. Existing untyped tasks remain untyped. Verified with focused integration tests, typecheck, Biome, build, the full 1496-test suite, and compiled-binary smoke.
