## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Track GitHub issue #289: add an output mode for viewing full task content when --plain is too compact.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 A task view option outputs the full markdown content or all structured sections without truncation.
- [x] #2 Existing plain output remains stable unless explicitly documented otherwise.
- [x] #3 Tests cover tasks containing markdown headings inside content sections.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Already implemented on main as of commit d0f3cff; closing with evidence instead of re-implementing. Evidence: 'backlog task view <id> --plain' outputs all structured sections in full with no truncation via formatTaskPlainText (src/formatters/task-plain-text.ts): metadata header, description, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done, implementation plan, implementation notes, comments, and final summary. Markdown headings inside section content are preserved because structured-section extraction (src/markdown/structured-sections.ts) only stops at known structured section headers, so custom '## ...'/'### ...' headings stay inside their section. Tests covering markdown headings inside content sections: src/test/update-task-description.test.ts ('### Subsection' preserved in implementation notes while editing description), src/test/implementation-notes.test.ts ('preserves nested H2 headings when migrating legacy implementation notes'), src/test/acceptance-criteria.test.ts ('preserves markdown headings inside acceptance criteria when updating'). Plain output shape is asserted stable in src/test/cli.test.ts. DoD: no code touched for this closure; tsc/biome/tests verified passing on main during triage.

Citation correction (review): plain output shape stability is asserted in src/test/cli-plain-output.test.ts (CLI plain output for AI agents, incl. 'task view --plain'), not src/test/cli.test.ts as previously written.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
No code change needed: --plain already emits the full task content (all structured sections, untruncated, headings preserved) with test coverage, satisfying the full-content output mode request. Closed as already implemented on main (d0f3cff). Tracks GitHub issue #289.
<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
