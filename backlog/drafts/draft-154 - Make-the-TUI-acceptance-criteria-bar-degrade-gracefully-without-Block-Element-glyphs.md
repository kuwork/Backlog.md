## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
src/ui/acceptance-criteria-progress.ts:22 builds the list/board progress bar from raw U+2588 FULL BLOCK and U+2591 LIGHT SHADE. blessed routes box-drawing characters through the DEC Special Graphics charset so trees and borders render on any terminal, but Block Elements go out as plain Unicode: a terminal font lacking those glyphs draws the bar as blank cells (maintainer-observed: a 9/10 bar rendered empty), and without a UTF-8 locale every glyph becomes a question mark. Make the bar degrade the way box drawing does: ASCII fill, or glyphs blessed routes through ACS.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The progress bar renders a visibly filled bar on terminals whose font lacks Block Element glyphs
- [x] #2 Rendering in a UTF-8-capable terminal with full fonts is unchanged or better
- [x] #3 A test pins the emitted characters
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Research: confirmed in neo-neo-bblessed lib/widgets/screen.ts (draw) that only DEC Special Graphics chars (tput.acscr) are ACS-routed; U+2588/U+2591 are in neither acscr nor the utoa ASCII fallback, so fonts without Block Elements show blanks and non-UTF-8 locales show '?'.
2. Decision: use plain ASCII '#' (filled) and '-' (empty) instead of ACS-routed glyphs. Rationale: the only DEC fill glyph is the checkerboard U+2592, which utoa maps to a space on broken/absent-ACS terminals (bar would vanish) and reads as half-shade; ASCII is below '~' so it bypasses every charset translation and renders identically on all terminals, fonts, and locales.
3. Change the bar characters in src/ui/acceptance-criteria-progress.ts only (BACK-652 covers the web component; PR #945 owns board.ts).
4. Update src/test/tui-acceptance-criteria-progress.test.ts to pin the emitted characters.
5. Verify: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun test.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Chose plain ASCII '#'/'-' over ACS-routed glyphs: the only DEC fill glyph (U+2592 checkerboard, ACS 'a') falls back to a *space* via blessed's utoa table on broken/absent-ACS terminals, so an ACS bar would vanish on exactly the degraded terminals this task targets; ASCII stays below '~' and bypasses every charset translation in neo-neo-bblessed screen draw, rendering identically on all terminals, fonts, and locales. Verification: bunx tsc --noEmit clean; bun run check . clean; full bun run test 2568 pass / 0 fail (one unrelated flake in an early run did not reproduce twice). Test pins exact bars ([######----] 4/7, [###--] 4/7, [#######---] 5/7, [##########] 2/2) plus an ASCII-only regex over varied widths/ratios. src/ui/root-entry.ts splash logo also uses Block Elements but is decorative and out of scope.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Replaced the raw U+2588/U+2591 bar cells in src/ui/acceptance-criteria-progress.ts with ASCII '#' (filled) and '-' (empty), so the list/board acceptance-criteria bar renders a visibly filled bar on any terminal font or locale instead of blank cells or question marks. Verified with pinned-character tests in src/test/tui-acceptance-criteria-progress.test.ts and green tsc, biome, and full bun test runs.
