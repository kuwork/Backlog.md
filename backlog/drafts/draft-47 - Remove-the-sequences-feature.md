## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Owner decision (Alex, July 4, 2026): sequences is an abandoned direction; remove the feature rather than finish it.

Remove the derived "sequences" execution-order feature end to end: the backlog sequence CLI command, sequence computation in core, the TUI sequences view, the /sequences server endpoints, and related docs and tests.

Important scope boundary: the task dependencies field and all dependency semantics stay. Only the derived sequences view/computation is removed.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The backlog sequence CLI command and its help text are removed
- [x] #2 Sequence computation (src/core/sequences.ts) and the TUI sequences view (src/ui/sequences.ts) are removed along with the Sequence type and core sequence methods
- [x] #3 The /sequences, /sequences/move, /api/sequences and /api/sequences/move server endpoints and their handlers are removed
- [x] #4 Task dependencies field and dependency semantics remain unchanged (create/edit --dep, validation, board/task views)
- [x] #5 README and CLI-INSTRUCTIONS no longer reference the sequences feature
- [x] #6 All sequences feature tests are removed and type checks, lint, and the test suite pass
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Remove backlog sequence CLI command and computeSequences import from src/cli.ts
2. Delete src/core/sequences.ts and src/ui/sequences.ts
3. Remove listActiveSequences/moveTaskInSequences and sequence imports from src/core/backlog.ts; remove Sequence type from src/types/index.ts
4. Remove /sequences, /sequences/move, /api/sequences, /api/sequences/move routes and handlers from src/server/index.ts
5. Delete sequences test files and the unused markdown-test-helpers.ts (dead code, mostly sequence parsers)
6. Update README.md and CLI-INSTRUCTIONS.md wording; keep dependency semantics intact
7. Archive BACK-217, BACK-217.02/.03/.04, BACK-218 via CLI
8. Gates: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun test; then rebase on origin/main and open PR with Breaking change section
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Removed: sequence CLI command (src/cli.ts), src/core/sequences.ts, src/ui/sequences.ts, core methods listActiveSequences/moveTaskInSequences, Sequence type, /sequences + /api/sequences endpoints and handlers, 5 sequences test files, unused src/test/markdown-test-helpers.ts (dead code, mostly sequence markdown parsers). Updated README bullet and CLI-INSTRUCTIONS dependency wording. Dependencies semantics untouched. Archived BACK-217, BACK-217.02-04, BACK-218.

Validation: bunx tsc --noEmit clean; bunx biome check src scripts package.json biome.json clean (bun run check . ignores worktree path); bun test 1363 pass / 1 fail = known pre-existing cli-priority-filtering timeout flake, passes in isolation (11/11).

Review fix: CLI-INSTRUCTIONS previously claimed circular-dependency prevention; the CLI only validates that referenced dependency tasks exist (validateDependencies in src/utils/task-builders.ts, no cycle detection). Corrected both lines in the Dependency Management section. To be precise: dependency existence validation remains unchanged.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Removed the sequences feature end to end: backlog sequence CLI command, src/core/sequences.ts, src/ui/sequences.ts, listActiveSequences/moveTaskInSequences in core, Sequence type, /sequences and /api/sequences server endpoints and handlers, 5 sequences test suites, and the unused markdown-test-helpers.ts. Updated README and CLI-INSTRUCTIONS wording. Dependencies field and semantics unchanged (verified --dep flags and views). Archived BACK-217, BACK-217.02-04, BACK-218. Verified with tsc, biome, and full bun test (only known flake failed, green in isolation).
<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
