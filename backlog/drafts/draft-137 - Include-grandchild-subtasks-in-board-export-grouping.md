## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The markdown board export builds its children map keyed only by top-level parents (src/board.ts ~90-140), so a subtask whose parent is itself a subtask is silently dropped from the exported board (GitHub issue #944). Fix the grouping to include nested subtasks; rendering depth/shape choices should follow the existing export format.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 A subtask of a subtask appears in the exported board markdown
- [x] #2 Existing flat parent/child export output is unchanged
- [x] #3 A test pins the nested case
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. In generateKanbanBoardWithMetadata (src/board.ts), replace the single-level top+children flattening with a depth-first emit: after pushing a task, recursively push its own children from the children map (sorted by ID ascending, as today). Flat data has no nested children, so output stays byte-identical.
2. Grandchildren keep the existing subtask rendering shape (single '└─ ' prefix), matching the current export format.
3. Add tests in src/test/board.test.ts: one pinning that a subtask-of-a-subtask appears in the export under its parent chain, one pinning the exact flat parent/child output unchanged.
4. Verify: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun test.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Root cause: generateKanbanBoardWithMetadata built each column as top-level tasks plus their direct children only; a subtask grouped under a parent that is itself a subtask (children map keyed by the intermediate id) was never emitted. Fix: depth-first pushWithChildren recursion over the existing children map; per-level ID-ascending sort kept. Flat output proven byte-identical: the new exact-output flat test passes against pre-fix board.ts (verified via git stash), while the nested test fails pre-fix and passes post-fix. Full suite: only 3 pre-existing tui-emoji-width failures remain, also failing on clean main in this environment.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Fixed the markdown board export dropping subtasks of subtasks (issue #944) by flattening each column depth-first over the existing children map in src/board.ts instead of one level deep; grandchildren keep the existing '└─ ' subtask shape. Verified with two new tests in src/test/board.test.ts: an exact-output test pinning the nested chain and an exact-output flat parent/child test that also passes against the pre-fix code, proving unchanged flat output. bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., and board tests all pass.
