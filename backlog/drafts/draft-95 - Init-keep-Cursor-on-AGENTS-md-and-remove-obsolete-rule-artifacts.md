## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Treat Cursor as a first-class Backlog init choice through the shared `AGENTS.md` instruction target. The `cursor` non-interactive alias, CLI wizard labels, agents update flow, and Web initialization must consistently direct Cursor users to `AGENTS.md`. Remove only obsolete Backlog-owned Cursor rule templates or references. Do not inspect, migrate, delete, or overwrite unrelated user-managed `.cursor/rules` content, and preserve existing `AGENTS.md` content and idempotent Backlog marker updates.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 CLI initialization accepts `--agent-instructions cursor` and maps it to `AGENTS.md`, while interactive CLI and agents-update selections identify Cursor under `AGENTS.md`
- [x] #2 Web initialization identifies `AGENTS.md` as the Cursor instruction file and sends that shared target to the init API
- [x] #3 Cursor selection creates or updates `AGENTS.md` and does not create `.cursor/rules`, `.cursorrules`, or another Cursor-specific Backlog instruction file
- [x] #4 Existing `AGENTS.md` content is preserved and repeated initialization keeps one current Backlog marker block
- [x] #5 Combined Cursor and other agent selections create each shared instruction target once without changing the behavior of Claude, Gemini, Copilot, MCP setup, or skip options
- [x] #6 Documentation and public init help explain that Cursor uses `AGENTS.md` and that unrelated user-managed Cursor rules may coexist without implicit migration or removal
- [x] #7 Focused real CLI tests cover non-interactive Cursor selection, combined selections, repeated init, and a PTY run that completes without opening an editor; focused Web coverage verifies the Cursor selector copy and `AGENTS.md` target
- [x] #8 Obsolete Backlog-owned Cursor rule templates and references are removed without deleting ambiguous or user-owned Cursor content
- [x] #9 Relevant focused and full tests, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run check .`, and `bun run build` pass
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Remove only dead Backlog-owned Cursor-specific guideline exports and marker branches; leave user Cursor rule paths untouched.
2. Keep the existing cursor-to-AGENTS.md mappings across CLI and Web init, and document the shared target plus coexistence with user-managed Cursor rules.
3. Add real CLI, PTY, idempotency, combined-selection, and Web selector coverage, then run focused and repository-wide verification before finalizing the task.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Approved direction implemented by PR #799: Cursor remains mapped to the shared AGENTS.md target across CLI, agents-update, and Web initialization. The change removes only obsolete Backlog-owned Cursor guideline and marker code; user-managed `.cursor/rules` content is preserved and may coexist without migration or removal. Focused coverage verifies existing AGENTS.md preservation, repeated init, shared-target deduplication, non-creation of Backlog Cursor rule files, a PTY no-editor flow, and the Web selector payload.

Final verification (2026-08-01): refreshed PR #799 head b6756726989084b2d70406fa69a9a42807be744d passed 10 current-head checks: Ubuntu/macOS/Windows lint-and-unit, Ubuntu/macOS/Windows compile-and-smoke, Nix packaging, both CodeQL analyses, and the CodeQL app check. Local merged-base verification passed 61 focused tests, the opt-in PTY test, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run check .`, `bun run build`, and `git diff --check`. Thread-aware review audit found no comments, reviews, or unresolved threads. PR #799 merged as d7202e7fe35340213335e8659fe3588ecc38e416.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Cursor remains a first-class init choice through the shared `AGENTS.md` target across CLI, agents-update, and Web flows. Obsolete Backlog-owned Cursor rule artifacts were removed while existing `AGENTS.md` content and user-managed `.cursor/rules` remain untouched. Verified by the full green current-head CI/CodeQL/Nix suite and focused local CLI, PTY, Web, typecheck, lint, build, and diff checks.
