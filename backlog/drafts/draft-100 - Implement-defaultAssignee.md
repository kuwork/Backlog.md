## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
GitHub issue #849. ADVANCED-CONFIG.md line 23 documents a `defaultAssignee` setting, but `config get` and `config set` reject it as an unknown key (src/cli.ts:4417-4420 and src/cli.ts:4630-4633) and no non-test code reads it. The setting is documented but entirely inert.

Most of the plumbing already exists: the type (src/types/index.ts:300), YAML parse and serialize (src/file-system/operations.ts:1504-1505 and src/file-system/operations.ts:1622), and the watcher key (src/utils/config-watcher.ts:33).

Maintainer decision: this is a bug in the implementation, not in the documentation. Implement the documented behavior rather than deleting the doc entry.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 `backlog config get defaultAssignee` returns the configured value
- [x] #2 `backlog config set defaultAssignee <value>` stores the value
- [x] #3 `backlog config list` includes defaultAssignee
- [x] #4 `backlog task create` with no -a applies the configured defaultAssignee
- [x] #5 An explicit -a on `task create` overrides the configured defaultAssignee
- [x] #6 ADVANCED-CONFIG.md accurately describes the shipped behavior
- [x] #7 Tests cover both the apply and the override paths
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Make `defaultAssignee` a string list (`string[]`) in BacklogConfig, matching the documented `[]` default and the multi-assignee task model from BACK-576. Parse accepts a legacy scalar (`default_assignee: "@alex"`), inline arrays, and block YAML sequences; serialize writes an inline list and omits the key when empty.
2. Wire config get/set/list: add defaultAssignee to CONFIG_GET_KEYS, CONFIG_SET_KEYS, CONFIG_AVAILABLE_KEYS; get prints comma-joined values; set parses with the shared parseDelimitedStringList (comma-separated), storing undefined for an empty value so the key is removed; list prints the bracketed list.
3. Apply the default in core createTaskFromInput (same layer as defaultStatus and definitionOfDone defaults), not in the CLI: every create surface (task create, draft create, creation wizard, TUI composer, web POST /api/tasks, MCP task_create) already funnels through it, so one change gives uniform behavior. Empty/absent assignee input applies the default; any explicit assignee replaces it entirely (no merging).
4. Update ADVANCED-CONFIG.md so the row describes the shipped list behavior and add the set example.
5. Tests: config get/set/list round-trip, YAML scalar/list parse compatibility, create-with-default and explicit-override across CLI task create, draft create, and core; update the two existing tests that typed defaultAssignee as a string.
6. Verify: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., scoped test files, then full bun test.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Placed the create-time default in core `createTaskFromInput` (src/core/backlog.ts), the same layer that already applies `defaultStatus` and the Definition of Done defaults. Every create surface funnels through that method — CLI `task create` and `draft create`, the creation wizard, the TUI composer (src/ui/board.ts, src/ui/unified-view.ts), the Web POST /api/tasks handler (src/server/index.ts), and MCP `task_create` (src/mcp/tools/tasks/handlers.ts) — so one change gives uniform behavior instead of per-surface wiring. Drafts get the default too: unlike status (forced to "Draft"), assignee has no draft-specific meaning.

Shape decision: `defaultAssignee` is now `string[]` rather than a single string. The doc already advertised `[]`, task assignees are a list, and keeping it a scalar would have re-created the BACK-576 defect where "@a,@b" is stored as one literal assignee. `parseConfig` still accepts the legacy scalar form (`default_assignee: "@alex"` becomes `["@alex"]`) plus inline arrays and block YAML sequences; `serializeConfig` writes an inline array and omits the key entirely when the list is empty.

Empty vs absent: at the CLI, `-a` is parsed by `parseDelimitedStringList`, so both an omitted flag and `-a ""` yield undefined and the default applies (same as labels). Any `-a` with real values replaces the default entirely — no merging. `config set defaultAssignee ""` stores undefined, which drops the key from config.yml, so new tasks start unassigned; this is documented in ADVANCED-CONFIG.md.

No change was needed in src/utils/config-watcher.ts: `default_assignee` is already a recognized key and is deliberately left out of ARRAY_CONFIG_KEYS so configs still using the legacy scalar form keep publishing live updates.

Also fixed a stale expectation in src/test/cli-guidance.test.ts, which asserts the literal `config set` key list in help output.

PR #867 review (Codex), three accepted findings fixed:

1. P1 instruction surface — with a configured defaultAssignee, omitting the flag now changes ownership, so agent-facing create surfaces say so. One clause each: the CLI task-creation guide (src/guidelines/cli-instructions/task-creation.md, Step 4 'Include' list), the `task create` help schema assignee entry (src/cli.ts), and the MCP `task_create` assignee property description (src/mcp/utils/schema-generators.ts). ADVANCED-CONFIG.md already documented it; these are the surfaces agents actually read.

2. P2 YAML escaping — serializing an assignee containing a double quote or backslash emitted invalid YAML. Now uses `JSON.stringify` per item, the same escape mechanism serializeConfig already uses for definition_of_done, rather than a bespoke one. Verified: `config set defaultAssignee '@a"b'` writes `default_assignee: ["@a\\"b"]` and round-trips through parse and task create.

3. P2 fail closed on malformed arrays — when both the YAML parser and parseInlineConfigList fail on a truncated array like `default_assignee: ["@a`, the legacy-scalar fallback used to reinterpret the raw text as a bracket-shaped assignee. Values starting with `[` are now rejected and the key is left unset, matching how the other list keys silently ignore malformed values; new tasks are created unassigned.

Tests added in src/test/config-commands.test.ts (escaped-assignee round trip through set/parse/create; malformed array yields undefined config and an unassigned task) and src/test/cli-guidance.test.ts (task-creation guide clause; the create help-schema assertion moved to the whitespace-normalized text so the longer description survives help wrapping).

Re-verified: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., config-commands + cli-guidance + mcp-server scoped runs, full bun run test (1955 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail).

PR #867 review round 2 (Codex), one accepted P2 fixed: the config watcher published a truncated inline `default_assignee` edit instead of retaining the last valid config, so a live half-written edit replaced a cached default with undefined. `default_assignee` stays out of ARRAY_CONFIG_KEYS (that check requires brackets unconditionally and would break legacy scalars and block sequences); instead `hasValidExplicitValues` now rejects only values that look like an inline array but do not parse as one.

The rule is shared, not duplicated: `parseInlineConfigList` moved from a private FileSystem method to a module-level export in src/file-system/operations.ts, and src/utils/config-watcher.ts imports it, so the watcher and the parser apply the identical 'starts with [ but malformed -> invalid' test. No import cycle: operations.ts imports neither config-watcher nor content-store.

Test added in src/test/config-watcher.test.ts covering all three paths through watchConfigFile: a truncated inline edit publishes nothing and leaves the cached defaultAssignee intact (proven by waiting for the read attempts to be exhausted, the same instrumentation the existing last-good-config test uses), then a legacy scalar edit reloads, then a valid inline array edit reloads. Confirmed the test fails on the unfixed watcher (the truncated content is published immediately and the attempt wait times out).

Re-verified: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., config-watcher + config-commands + filesystem scoped runs, full bun run test (1956 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail).

PR #867 review round 3 (Codex), two accepted P2s fixed by removing their shared root cause rather than patching each case. Both symptoms came from hand-rolled quoting: an unbalanced quote (`["@alice]`) satisfied the start/end bracket test and the naive splitter returned ["@alice"], and a scalar with a trailing YAML comment kept the comment in the value (`@alice # owner`).

Simplification: the defaultAssignee value path no longer does textual parsing at all. One shared `parseAssigneeConfigValue` parses the line's value as YAML and returns nothing when YAML rejects it or it is not a string or list; `parseConfig` and the watcher's `hasValidExplicitValues` both call it, so a value the parser refuses is exactly the value the watcher treats as invalid (retain last-good). Quoting, escapes and comments are the parser's job now. The bespoke `parseInlineConfigList` is no longer used for this key and is private again; the other list keys keep using it untouched.

The textual legacy-scalar fallback was deleted entirely rather than narrowed. Testing what the old code accepted showed the only non-YAML form it could take is an unquoted `@name` (`@` is a reserved YAML indicator), and no such file can exist in practice: the serializer has always written the quoted form, init and the Web UI never wrote the key, and the setting was inert before this PR, so there is no legacy behavior to preserve. ADVANCED-CONFIG.md now tells hand-editors to quote the names.

Parser choice: `Bun.YAML.parse` (Bun is pinned to 1.3.14 in CI) rather than the gray-matter frontmatter parser. gray-matter needs a synthetic `---` document wrapper around the value, and it caches by input string while inserting the cache entry before parsing, so after a throw the second call with the same string returns an empty result instead of throwing. That is not theoretical: it made the first draft of this fix accept malformed values in the watcher, because parseConfig had already poisoned the cache for that exact string. Reproduced, then avoided by using a parser with no wrapper and no cache.

Tests: both repro cases in src/test/config-commands.test.ts (trailing comment on scalar and inline forms yields a clean @alice; truncated and unbalanced-quote values leave the key unset and create unassigned tasks) and in src/test/config-watcher.test.ts (both malformed edits publish nothing and retain the cached default, then a scalar edit and a valid inline array each reload). Confirmed the two config tests fail against the previous textual parser. The watcher test's readiness signal was lowered from 8 parse attempts to 3 because a torn read consumes an attempt without a parse, while accepted content is parsed exactly once, so 3 still separates rejected from accepted.

Follow-up observed but deliberately not changed here: statuses/labels/types/priorities still use the textual fallback, so `statuses: ["To Do]` silently parses to ["To Do"] and the watcher accepts it - the same defect class, now fixed only for default_assignee.

Re-verified: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., config-commands + config-watcher scoped runs, full bun run test (1956 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail).

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Made the documented `defaultAssignee` setting work end to end. `config get/set/list` now accept it (added to CONFIG_GET_KEYS, CONFIG_SET_KEYS and the available-keys message), and the config value is a string list parsed with the shared `parseDelimitedStringList`, so `backlog config set defaultAssignee "@alice,@bob"` stores both names instead of one literal "@a,@b" assignee. The default is applied in core `createTaskFromInput`, the single create path shared by CLI task/draft create, the creation wizard, the TUI, the Web API and MCP, so every surface behaves the same: no assignee input applies the default, any explicit assignee replaces it entirely, an empty configured list leaves tasks unassigned. `BacklogConfig.defaultAssignee` changed from `string` to `string[]`; config parsing still accepts the legacy scalar form as well as inline arrays and block YAML sequences, and serialization omits the key when the list is empty. ADVANCED-CONFIG.md now describes the shipped list behavior and the override/clear semantics.

Verified with live CLI runs of all five behavior criteria in a scratch project (get/set/list, create with and without -a, draft create, legacy scalar and block-sequence configs), new tests in config-commands, core, cli-init-create and draft-create-consistency, plus bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., and two full `bun run test` runs (1953 pass, 0 fail).
