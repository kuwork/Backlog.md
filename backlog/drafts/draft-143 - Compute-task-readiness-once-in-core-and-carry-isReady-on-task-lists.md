## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Readiness is a domain concept that four interfaces currently recompute for themselves: the TUI builds its own graph (buildReadinessGraph in task-viewer-with-search.ts), the browser builds one from the board corpus inside TaskDetailsModal.tsx, and the CLI and MCP each call loadReadinessGraph. That is the same duplication BACK-548 removed for dependency graphs, and it has already produced divergence: the browser answers from the board corpus, so its verdict can differ from the CLI's for the same task, which is where the BACK-601 gaps came from.

Fold readiness into core the way the dependency graph was folded in. It derives from the same corpus loadTaskCorpus already builds (createReadinessGraph and buildDependencyGraph take the same options shape), so one corpus load answers both questions and they can never disagree.

Two carriers, because the two shapes have different costs and audiences. Task lists, search results, and board projections carry a plain isReady boolean per task, computed in one pass over the corpus rather than per task, so a list interface never issues N+1 lookups to decide what to grey out or badge. Task details carry the fuller readiness beside dependencyGraph, including the blockers the browser modal already renders through formatReadinessBlockers.

Interfaces then only display. No surface may build a readiness graph of its own after this. Readiness stays derived at read time and is never written into the Markdown record.

Watch the cost of readiness on list paths: it needs the completed corpus to know whether a dependency is finished, and list loads do not all pay for that today. Measure before making every list load the completed corpus, and keep allocation and other non-display paths off the readiness work entirely.

This likely dissolves most of BACK-601, whose three gaps are all consequences of per-surface computation.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Readiness is computed in core from the same corpus as the dependency graph, once per read, and no interface calls createReadinessGraph or loadReadinessGraph directly
- [ ] #2 Task list, search, and board projections carry an isReady boolean per task computed in a single corpus pass, with no per-task lookup in any interface
- [x] #3 Task detail carries readiness alongside dependencyGraph, including blockers, and the browser modal renders that instead of computing its own
- [x] #4 task list --json exposes isReady per task and task view --json exposes the detail readiness, both additive to the existing contracts
- [x] #5 CLI --ready, MCP ready, and the TUI ready filter all resolve through the shared computation and agree with each other and with the browser for the same task
- [x] #6 List read paths do not regress measurably; the completed corpus is loaded only where readiness is actually rendered, and allocation paths do no readiness work
- [x] #7 Automated tests cover agreement across surfaces, isReady on list payloads, blocked and unblocked chains, completed dependencies, and unresolved or ambiguous dependencies failing closed
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Core fold (src/core/task-detail.ts): TaskDetail gains readiness beside dependencyGraph; add TaskListItem = Task & { isReady }; toTaskDetail(task, corpus) replaces withDependencyGraph and derives both from one corpus; withReadiness(tasks, corpus) builds the readiness graph once and maps the list in a single pass; loadTaskListItems(core, tasks) mirrors loadTaskDetail; add the taskReadiness(task) accessor next to taskDependencyGraph. Delete loadReadinessGraph from utils/readiness.ts (it becomes a pure util again) and delete the ready?: ReadinessGraph option from utils/task-search.ts so no surface can pass a graph of its own.
2. CLI: task list attaches readiness only where it is rendered or filtered (--ready or --json); --ready filters the projection instead of building a graph. search --json attaches readiness in one corpus pass. Plain/text list, edit, create and allocation paths keep loading no completed corpus.
3. JSON contract (additive, schemaVersion 1): isReady on the shared task summary used by task list --json and search --json task results; readiness (isReady, isBlocked, blockingDependencies, missingDependencies) on task view --json beside dependencyGraph. Update CLI-INSTRUCTIONS.md field lists.
4. MCP: both ready branches (drafts and tasks) filter the shared projection instead of calling loadReadinessGraph.
5. TUI: the viewer already holds a live TaskCorpus; build the detail with toTaskDetail and filter the ready list with withReadiness over that corpus. generateDetailContent renders the readiness carried by the task it was handed and drops its readinessGraph option, so a caller without a detail still gets no readiness claim.
6. Web: the task-details modal renders the readiness the detail read delivers and drops its own createReadinessGraph plus the per-dependency off-board fetches. App.tsx preserves readiness with dependencyGraph when the list refresh replaces the record, and re-reads the detail when dependencies or status change.
7. Performance: measure the completed-corpus cost before adding it to any list path and record the numbers; keep readiness off the web board/search endpoint until the follow-up ready filter renders it.
8. Tests: cross-surface agreement (CLI/MCP/TUI/web on one project), isReady on task list --json and search --json payloads, blocked and unblocked chains, dependencies completed into backlog/completed, and unresolved or ambiguous dependencies failing closed; rewrite the existing readiness and task-search tests onto the shared projection.
9. Gates: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run test.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Core fold: TaskDetail now carries readiness beside dependencyGraph, and a new TaskListItem (Task & { isReady }) is what lists, search results and board projections return. toTaskDetail (renamed from withDependencyGraph) derives both from one corpus in one call; withReadiness builds the readiness index once and maps a whole list in a single pass; loadTaskListItems mirrors loadTaskDetail for surfaces that read per list. Added the taskReadiness accessor next to taskDependencyGraph.

Deleted: loadReadinessGraph (utils/readiness.ts is a pure util again, no Core import), the ready?: ReadinessGraph filter option and its predicate in utils/task-search.ts, the TUI's buildReadinessGraph plus the readinessGraph option on generateDetailContent, and the browser modal's createReadinessGraph call together with the per-dependency off-board fetch effect it existed for (that fetch was the N+1 BACK-601 round 4 flagged; the alias-duplication bug it caused is gone with it). Net: 20 files changed, more deleted than added in the surfaces.

Surfaces now only render: CLI --ready filters the projection; MCP ready (tasks and drafts) filters the same projection; the TUI derives readiness over the filtered list against its live corpus (which already merges in-session completions) and the detail pane renders task.readiness; the browser modal renders the readiness the detail read delivers.

JSON contract (additive, schemaVersion 1): isReady on the shared task summary used by task list --json and search --json task results, and readiness (isReady, isBlocked, blockingDependencies, missingDependencies) on task view --json. CLI-INSTRUCTIONS.md field lists updated. Never serialized: serializeTask whitelists frontmatter keys, so neither field can reach Markdown.

Performance, measured A/B against origin/main on this repo (199 active + 455 completed records, same backlog dir via BACKLOG_CWD, 3 runs each): task list --plain 273-279ms base vs 279-325ms branch (unchanged code path, no completed corpus loaded); task list --json 267-286ms vs 282-307ms (about +15ms for the one completed-corpus read); task list --plain --ready 103-111ms vs 102-108ms (unchanged); search --json 3.59s vs 3.64s. The readiness pass itself is ~1ms for 199 rows over a 654-record corpus. Allocation, edit, create and plain/interactive list paths load no completed corpus at all.

Scoped deliberately: the browser's list/board corpus (GET /api/search, which is what App.tsx loads the board and task list from) does not carry isReady. Nothing in the browser renders it today (the modal badge comes from the detail read), that endpoint also serves the per-keystroke search box, and a corpus load there measured ~17ms per request on this repo. The follow-up web ready filter should add it where the UI renders it.

Verification: bunx tsc --noEmit clean; bun run check . clean; bun run test 2809 pass / 8 skip / 0 fail across 281 files (2805 before, +4 new). RUN_INTERACTIVE_TUI_TESTS=1 bun test src/test/tui-ready-filter-pty.test.ts passes, so the interactive --ready render is still correct end to end. New src/test/readiness-surface-agreement.test.ts runs one project through the CLI list JSON, --ready, task view JSON, MCP task_list ready, the browser detail endpoint and the interactive corpus and asserts one shared verdict, plus a contested-identity case that fails closed on every read that still answers.

Rendered browser QA on a disposable project (completed dependency, unfinished chain, unknown dependency): TASK-3 shows 'Ready to start' with its dependency living in backlog/completed (the case the deleted off-board fetch used to handle), TASK-4 shows 'Blocked by TASK-2', TASK-5 shows 'Unknown dependency TASK-404', no console errors. Liveness re-checked: changing the open task's status to Done inline removes the badge and changing it back restores 'Blocked by TASK-2'; adding a dependency out of band while the modal is open refreshes the badge to 'Blocked by TASK-3'. A dependency completed elsewhere while a modal stays open refreshes when the detail is read again, the same staleness the dependency graph already has.

AC #2 left unchecked: the CLI task list and search JSON projections, the MCP list and the interactive list all carry or filter on the single-pass isReady, but the browser's board and task-list corpus (GET /api/search) does not, for the reason recorded above. Everything else in that criterion holds; the remaining half is a one-line addition to that endpoint whenever the web ready filter renders it, and it needs a product call on paying the per-request cost before anything displays it.

Review round 1 (Codex on PR #986), three findings fixed:

1. P1 regression in the browser (src/web/App.tsx, new src/web/utils/task-detail-sync.ts). The first sync only compared the open task's own status and dependency IDs, so a dependency completing or being reopened elsewhere left the badge stale indefinitely - the browser used to catch that by recomputing from the board corpus. The whole decision now lives in syncOpenTaskDetail: it fingerprints what readiness actually answers about (this task's status and dependency list, plus every corpus record claiming one of those dependency IDs), drops the verdict and asks for one detail re-read when that moves, and keeps the dependency graph in place so it never flickers. It also replaces the effect's record-identity early return, which was the real blocker: the list reconcile preserves object identity for unchanged records, so a refresh that only changed the dependency never reached the comparison at all. One request for the task, never one per dependency.

2. P2 in task list (src/cli.ts). --ready --json derived readiness twice: once to filter and once to serialize, doubling the completed-corpus read and letting a concurrent write between them publish isReady:false for a row the filter selected as ready. Ordering, the parent narrowing and the limit moved into one narrowForDisplay helper so the single projection travels through to the payload.

3. P2 in search --json (src/cli.ts, src/formatters/json-output.ts). The verdicts were rejoined to results by task ID, so with two files claiming one ID one claimant being ready marked every result with that ID ready - fail-open on exactly the identity case this project fails closed on. searchJson now takes results whose records already carry readiness, consumed in result order, so each claimant keeps its own verdict.

Tests, each verified failing before its fix and passing after:
- src/test/web-task-detail-readiness-sync.test.tsx (jsdom): a dependency completed out of band while the record itself keeps identity - pre-fix rule reports changed:false and the modal keeps rendering 'Blocked by BACK-1'; post-fix the verdict is dropped, a re-read is requested, and the fresh detail renders 'Ready to start'. Second case pins that unrelated edits keep the verdict and ask for no read.
- src/test/cli-task-list.test.ts 'serializes --ready --json from the readiness pass the filter used': counts completed-corpus reads (an unparsable completed record logs once per read under DEBUG) - pre-fix 3 vs 2 for --plain --ready, post-fix equal.
- src/test/readiness-surface-agreement.test.ts 'search JSON readiness for a contested identity': two records claiming one ID, one blocked and one ready - pre-fix both serialize as ready, post-fix each keeps its own verdict.

Rendered re-verification on a disposable project with the modal open on a blocked task: completing its blocker from the CLI flips the badge to 'Ready to start' within a refresh, reopening it flips back to 'Blocked by TASK-1', inline status edits still drop and restore it, no console errors.

Correction to the earlier performance note: every task list command already reads the completed corpus once, in printDuplicateIntegrityWarning -> findLocalDuplicateTaskIds, which predates this task. Measured with DEBUG read counting: --plain 1 read (unchanged), --json 2, --plain --ready 2, --ready --json 3 before this fix and 2 after. So readiness adds at most one corpus read, only where the verdict is filtered on or published, and the plain path adds none.

Owner decision recorded: isReady is deliberately NOT added to GET /api/search (the browser's board and task-list corpus) ahead of the web ready-filter UI. AC #2 stays unchecked for that half.

Review round 2 (Codex on PR #986), four findings fixed:

1. P1, the refresh fingerprint could not see every readiness input. The detail read derives readiness from the completed corpus, the configured terminal status and the store's contested identities, none of which reach the browser, so a dependency filed as completed work (or a terminal-status config change) moved the verdict with nothing visible changing. The open task's detail is now re-read on every data refresh: applySearchResults advances a refresh generation, syncOpenTaskDetail treats a generation it has not read for as a reason to re-read, and the visible fingerprint is now only what decides whether the badge on screen is already known wrong and has to go immediately. Still one read of the open task, never one per dependency; idle costs nothing.

2. P2, detail reads could land out of order. Every read of the open task now goes through readOpenTaskDetail, which takes a ticket and applies a response only while it is still the newest one asked for. The upgrade-in-place read from the pages without a task route goes through the same path, so it cannot race a refresh read either.

3. P2, search --json loaded the whole corpus for a search that matched no task. It now derives readiness only when there is at least one task result.

4. P2, the modal showed a carried verdict against an optimistic status. The badge now requires the shown status to match the record the verdict was read for, exactly as it already required for dependencies, so an in-flight or failed inline status change shows no badge instead of a contradictory one.

Tests, each verified red before its fix and green after:
- src/test/web-app-open-detail-refresh.test.tsx mounts the real App over jsdom with a stubbed API and socket. 're-reads the detail on a refresh that changed nothing the browser can see' files a completed record for a dependency that never appears in the corpus: pre-fix it times out with 'Unknown dependency TASK-9' still on screen. 'ignores a detail read that a newer one has already overtaken' holds two reads open and answers newest-first: pre-fix the stale answer overwrites and the modal falls back to 'Unknown dependency TASK-9'.
- src/test/cli-json-output.test.ts 'reads no task corpus for a search that matched no task' counts completed-corpus reads for a document-only search: pre-fix 3 against the plain baseline of 2, post-fix equal.
- src/test/web-task-detail-readiness-sync.test.tsx 'hides the verdict while an optimistic status edit is ahead of the record' drives the status select with the save left in flight: pre-fix the modal still renders 'Blocked by BACK-1' next to a Done status.

That test file plants globals (a fake WebSocket above all) and now restores every one of them, after an earlier run leaked the stub into the suites that open real sockets.

Rendered verification of the P1 case: with the modal open on a task whose only dependency is TASK-9 and no such record anywhere, writing backlog/completed/task-9 flips the badge from 'Unknown dependency TASK-9' to 'Ready to start' while the modal stays open, with nothing in the browser's corpus changing. Request cost measured in the page: zero detail reads over six idle seconds, exactly one for one unrelated file change, no console errors.

Review round 3 (Codex on PR #986):

1. P2 regression, draft readiness. openDraftModal handed the modal the drafts-page list record and never read the detail, so the badge the old modal-side derivation showed for drafts was gone. openDraftModal now reads the draft's detail through readOpenTaskDetail, the same sequenced path every other detail read uses; GET /api/task/DRAFT-1 already returns a core-derived verdict for drafts (verified against a live server: readiness isReady false, blockingDependencies [TASK-1]). Drafts are not in the task corpus the modal syncs against, so this read is what supplies their verdict.

2. P2, cross-branch search readiness. Premise verified and answered without a behaviour change; see the corpus note below.

3. P2, routed detail reads bypassed the ordering. Every detail read now goes through readTaskDetail, which takes the ticket and reports whether its answer still counts; the route loader consumes it and keeps its own route-staleness guard, and closing the modal retires the ticket so a read left in flight cannot reopen or overwrite whatever is opened next.

Tests, red before their fix and green after:
- src/test/web-app-open-detail-refresh.test.tsx 'reads the detail of a draft opened from the drafts page' mounts the app on /drafts and clicks the draft: pre-fix it times out with no badge at all.
- Same file, 'drops a detail read left in flight when the modal is closed and reopened': pre-fix the stale answer reinstates 'Unknown dependency TASK-9' over the reopened modal's 'Ready to start'.
Full suite 2819 pass / 8 skip / 0 fail, and the run leaves no stray files or globals behind (the harness restores every global it plants).

Corpus note for finding 2, with evidence. backlog search does read the cross-branch ContentStore: on a two-branch probe the store snapshot and the search results both contain a task that exists only on the other branch (source local-branch, branch other) while loadTaskCorpus(core) does not. But the rows search --json publishes are local-editable records only (searchJson filters with isLocalEditableTask), and for an identity the working copy holds the store resolves to the local record - TASK-1 was reported To Do although branch other has it Done. The corpora therefore differ in exactly one case: a dependency resolvable only on another branch. Measured on that probe, local corpus gives TASK-4 isReady false, cross-branch gives true. Two things make aligning search alone the wrong fix: the CLI refuses to create such a dependency at all ('The following dependencies do not exist: TASK-3. ... Task lookups read only the local working copy; use backlog browser to see tasks from other branches'), and task view --json reports the same false for the hand-written case, so search --json agrees with the rest of the CLI today. Making search's readiness cross-branch would make it disagree with task view --json and task list --json for the same task, which is the divergence this task exists to remove; making all CLI readiness cross-branch is a policy change against the standing CLI local-only read decision and the documented BACK-601 gap 3. Left unchanged and raised for Alex.

Review round 4 (Codex on PR #986, with an independent design review): the web detail-read path was rebuilt around one invariant instead of gaining a fourth guard.

Structure. The modal is one discriminated state: closed, create, or detail carrying { session, id, isDraft, fromRoute, value }. Every entry path - a clicked task, a routed task, a draft, a graph link - opens a new session before any read starts. One effect keyed by (session, id, dataVersion) performs exactly one fetchTask; its cleanup retires that read, and a response is applied only while the state is still a detail with the same session and id. showModal, editingTask and isDraftMode are now projections of that one value, so the render tree is unchanged.

Why the races are gone rather than handled: an older task's read cannot answer for a newer one because navigation establishes the new session before the response arrives and the response names the old one; out-of-order responses cannot land because starting a newer key cleans up the older effect; closing retires everything in flight; and a refresh is one authoritative re-read, which is what covers records the browser never receives (completed corpus, terminal status, contested identities) and drafts, which are not in the task corpus at all. Nothing consults tasks.find any more: search records are no longer merged into a detail, because the detail endpoint is authoritative.

Deleted: src/web/utils/task-detail-sync.ts and its import, syncedTaskRecordRef, detailReadRef, openDetailKeyRef, dataVersionRef, taskRouteRequestRef, isTaskRouteModalRef, both reader helpers, the ticket retirement in clearTaskModal, the route loader's fetch and its counters, and the corpus-merging sync effect. The two unit tests of the deleted merge helper went with it; the file was renamed to web-task-readiness-badge.test.tsx keeping the optimistic-status test.

Deviations from the reviewed design, all deliberate: (1) the detail case carries fromRoute so a failed first read reports back through the route - it replaces isTaskRouteModalRef, so it is a net deletion; (2) no loading state - showModal is create or a detail that has a value, so a routed task appears when its first read lands exactly as before, rather than inventing loading UI in a closing round; (3) a modalRef mirror lets the route effect skip re-opening the session it already opened for the same route id without taking the state as a dependency.

CLI: task list derives readiness only when there are rows to describe, so an empty result set reads no corpus. --limit 0 is unreachable - --limit is validated as a positive integer and rejected before any read.

Tests, red against 59f585ae and green now: 'keeps the routed task on screen when an older task's refresh read answers late' (pre-fix the modal never shows the routed task at all) and 're-reads an open draft when the data refreshes' (pre-fix the draft badge never updates). 'reads no task corpus when the filters matched no task' counts completed-corpus reads for an empty filter result. Every earlier regression test still passes unchanged. Full suite 2820 pass / 8 skip / 0 fail.

Rendered verification: routed open, blocker completed out of band (badge flips), close and reopen another task, draft opened from the Drafts page, blocker reopened while the draft modal is open (draft badge flips), inline status edit persisted; no console errors, and zero detail reads while idle.

Known limitation, recorded rather than machined around: freshness depends on a refresh signal arriving. If none does, or if the newest detail read fails, the last successful detail stays on screen.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Readiness became a derived field computed once in core, exactly like the dependency graph in BACK-548: toTaskDetail answers readiness and the graph from one corpus in one call, withReadiness maps a whole list from a single index, and every surface only renders the result. Removed the four separate computations (TUI buildReadinessGraph, browser modal createReadinessGraph plus its per-dependency fetches, CLI and MCP loadReadinessGraph) and the ready graph option in task-search, so no interface can reach a verdict of its own. task list --json and search --json now publish isReady and task view --json publishes readiness with its blockers, additive under schemaVersion 1 and documented in CLI-INSTRUCTIONS.md. Verified with bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run test (2809 pass, 0 fail), the interactive --ready PTY test, a new cross-surface agreement suite covering completed, blocked, unknown and contested dependencies, and rendered browser QA of the three badge states with inline and out-of-band edits. Readiness stays read-time only: serializeTask whitelists frontmatter, so neither field can reach Markdown. Measured A/B on a 654-record project: plain and interactive list reads and allocation paths load no completed corpus and are unchanged; only task list --json pays for it, about +15ms.
