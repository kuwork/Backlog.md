## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Issue #689 reports that Backlog sees active branches/worktrees only at startup and does not refresh later when check_active_branches is true. Investigate whether the local branch/worktree task scanner caches state incorrectly, reproduce if feasible, and make the smallest safe fix.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 With check_active_branches: true, task search/listing reflects newly committed task changes in another worktree after Backlog has already started
- [x] #2 Focused tests cover refreshing branch/worktree state without broad feature expansion
- [x] #3 If no safe fix is clear, leave a precise diagnostic or GitHub comment explaining the observed behavior
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Reproduce the stale long-lived process path with a real git worktree: initialize a watcher-backed Core, query once, commit a task on a second worktree branch, then query again with check_active_branches enabled.
2. Reuse ContentStore's existing cross-branch loader refresh instead of adding a new scanner or watcher layer.
3. Refresh tasks before watcher-backed cross-branch reads/searches after initial startup, preserving CLI one-shot behavior and check_active_branches=false behavior.
4. Run focused tests plus type/check validation as needed.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented the fix in the existing ContentStore/Core path. Diagnosis: direct branch scans were fresh, but watcher-backed long-lived Core instances served list/search results from the initialized ContentStore until a current-worktree filesystem event happened. Reused the loader-backed task refresh before watcher-backed cross-branch reads, and guarded no-op refreshes so unchanged snapshots do not notify clients.

Validation: bun test src/test/worktree-refresh.test.ts; bun test src/test/content-store.test.ts src/test/search-service.test.ts; bun test src/test/find-task-in-branches.test.ts src/test/worktree-refresh.test.ts; bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check . Full bun test run had 1341 pass / 2 skip / 1 timeout in CLI Priority Filtering > case insensitive priority filtering; rerunning that single test passed.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Fixed stale long-lived task reads for worktree branch changes by refreshing the existing loader-backed ContentStore before watcher-backed cross-branch list/search queries. Added a git-worktree regression that starts on main, initializes list/search caches, commits a task in another worktree branch, and verifies the original Core sees it without restart. Verified with focused tests, typecheck, Biome, and reran the only full-suite timeout successfully.

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
