## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The Linux full-suite CI repeatedly times out the MCP milestone task_create/task_edit regression at 10 seconds while the same test passes quickly in isolation. Find the deterministic wait, leaked resource, or concurrency interaction rather than masking it with a larger timeout. Keep this repair isolated from PR #757.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The full-suite interaction that causes the MCP milestone mutation test to stall is reproduced or localized with deterministic focused coverage
- [x] #2 The underlying wait, resource leak, or concurrency defect is fixed without increasing the test or CI timeout
- [x] #3 Focused regression coverage proves task_create milestone assignment and task_edit milestone clearing complete and preserve existing semantics
- [x] #4 TypeScript, Biome, focused tests, full isolated tests, and compiled build pass
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add deterministic fake-watcher regressions for task, document, and decision events where the first same-identity read is the unchanged cache, changed bytes appear later, and no second watcher event fires.
2. Replace in-queue retry sleeps with coalesced per-identity deferred rechecks scheduled outside chainTail; each timer enqueues one targeted reconciliation read and uses root epoch, disposal, and watcher-stop guards.
3. Preserve fast duplicate no-ops, wrong-identity rejection, incomplete-read recovery, collection symmetry, and filename/existence-driven deletion; cover root-change and disposal cancellation.
4. Treat only authoritative filename-derived rename reconciliation as evidence to cancel a pending identity job; unrelated, null, and equal wildcard snapshots must leave targeted delayed writes alive.
5. Give a genuinely fresh same-key watcher event a fresh bounded retry window while retaining a single coalesced timer and a hard bound for duplicate storms.
6. Reconcile rename/delete by identity: read the event path when present, otherwise enumerate only filename candidates for that identity and classify the result as found, authoritatively absent, or incomplete.
7. Preserve cached content and schedule bounded retry for incomplete candidate reads; delete only after a complete absent result, while malformed unrelated siblings never influence the target.
8. Preserve wildcard no-polling, root/dispose guards, task/document/decision symmetry, then stress queue timing, rename/delete, lifecycle, and MCP milestone mutation.
9. Run TypeScript, Biome, build, diff review, and the full isolated suite; record fail-first and final verification fingerprints without pushing or touching GitHub threads.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Investigation localized both Ubuntu failures to duplicate ContentStore task reconciliation, not MCP transport or the task-create lock. CI continued the timed-out test and later reported its clear assertion after subsequent tests had begun. The serialized watcher path requires a task to differ from the cached snapshot; when an in-process write already published that snapshot, retryRead waits 4,950ms and the collection fallback waits another 4,950ms. A deterministic local probe measured 4,986ms + 4,987ms = 9,973ms, matching the 10s CI timeout. The fix will preserve retries for invalid reads but treat valid unchanged snapshots as completed no-ops.

Implemented shared ContentStore no-op reconciliation: readable expected task, document, and decision snapshots now leave retryRead immediately, while post-read change detection suppresses duplicate publication. The deterministic fail-first test initially observed 22 scheduled delays in the task targeted-plus-collection path; the standalone baseline probe measured 9,973ms. The final queue-liveness regression covers all three content types and schedules zero delays, while its paired incomplete-read regression proves two invalid reads still schedule 75ms and 150ms retries before publication. Focused verification: ContentStore plus MCP milestone suites 42/42; queue/retry stress 200/200; watcher-enabled MCP task_create milestone assignment and task_edit clearing stress 50/50. Static/build verification: bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check passed. Final full verification: bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 passed 1,646 tests with 2 intentional skips and 0 failures across 189 files.

Spec review of bf247f5 found that targeted task and decision reads accepted any non-null entity. The fail-first regression returned foreign ID, then null, then the requested entity; bf247f5 stopped after one read instead of three and could publish TASK-999 or decision-999. Re-audit reasoning: updateTaskFromDisk and updateDecisionFromDisk are invoked only after the patched filesystem save promise completes. A parsed result with the requested identity—even if already equal to the cache—is therefore a converged no-op published earlier in the queue. Null or a different identity cannot represent the completed requested save and must remain retryable. The document collection path already requires the expected document ID before publication, and direct watcher parsers validate filename identity. Deletion is separate: watcher branches require exists=false and remove only the filename-derived cached ID; focused coverage now exercises task, document, and decision deletion together.

Review fix completed: targeted task reads now require taskIdsEqual with the normalized requested ID, and targeted decision reads require exact decision ID equality. The fail-first fingerprint on bf247f5 was expected three reads but received one after a foreign-ID result; the corrected regression observes foreign ID, null, then the requested entity and proves no foreign task, document, or decision ID is ever published. The analogous document collection validator was already identity-strict. An initial simultaneous three-file deletion stress exposed watcher event coalescing in the test itself, so deletion coverage now removes and observes task, document, and decision sequentially; it passed 100/100 without timeout changes. Final review-fix verification: focused ContentStore plus MCP suites 42/42 with 179 assertions; queue/retry stress 200/200; deletion stress 100/100; MCP milestone create/clear stress 50/50; bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check passed. Full bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 passed 1,646 with 2 intentional skips, 0 failures, and 6,720 assertions across 189 files in 172.32s.

Quality audit of 0125c0e identified a delayed-valid-write gap: a single filesystem event can observe old but valid same-identity bytes, treat them as a completed no-op, and never see later changed bytes when no second event arrives. The follow-up will model exactly one watcher callback with captured fake node:fs watchers and keep every retry delay outside the shared serialized chain.

Quality-audit correction completed. Exact fail-first harness replaces node:fs.watch with captured callbacks, fires one task, document, and decision change event while disk still exposes the cached same-identity bytes, waits for the shared queue to drain, then writes changed bytes through an unpatched FileSystem without a second event. On 0125c0e it failed in 1.055s with “Timed out waiting for delayed content visibility after one watcher event”; the corrected implementation converges in about 80–107ms.

ContentStore now uses one epoch-bound, per-identity deferred recheck registry. Every queue turn performs a single read; invalid or direct-watcher unchanged observations arm the existing 12-attempt linear backoff outside chainTail, and each timer enqueues a fresh targeted read against current disk and cache state. Same-key events coalesce without resetting the job, successful/new/deleted observations cancel it, and root watcher stop/dispose clear timers and tokens. Task direct reads preserve filePath so an old snapshot compares equal accurately. Wildcard collection no-ops deliberately remain terminal: an initial attempt to retry them caused pending collection loads to steal the lifecycle test’s config-load gate; after restoring the targeted-vs-wildcard policy, A→B→A lifecycle stress passed 20/20.

Final corrective verification: ContentStore 11/11 with 68 assertions; MCP milestones 33/33 with 127 assertions; queue/delayed/lifecycle/incomplete stress 200/200; deletion stress 50/50; MCP milestone create/clear stress 50/50; A→B→A lifecycle stress 20/20. bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check . (324 files), bun run build, and git diff --check passed. Authoritative bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 passed 1,648 tests with 2 intentional skips, 0 failures, and 6,736 assertions across 189 files in 173.86s.

Second quality review found a stale-path race: a direct watcher could schedule an unchanged old-path retry, then wildcard rename reconciliation could publish the same identity from its new path without cancelling the identity job. Firing the old timer afterward deleted the freshly published task, document, or decision. Deterministic fail-first on a0f670b published all three renamed entities, fired the captured old timers with no later event, and failed first at the task assertion: expected Renamed Task, received undefined. The smallest shared correction cancels each published entity identity key from the existing deferred registry inside collection replacement; absent identities keep their recovery jobs, and wildcard unchanged reads remain terminal.

Stale-path correction verification: deterministic rename regression passed 50/50 with 600 assertions; the complete ContentStore suite passed 10/10 runs with 120 tests and 800 assertions; the watcher-enabled MCP milestone blocking regression passed 5/5. Focused ContentStore plus MCP suites passed 45/45 with 207 assertions. bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check . (324 files), bun run build, and git diff --check passed. Authoritative bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 passed 1,649 tests with 2 intentional skips, 0 failures, and 6,748 assertions across 189 files in 187.13s.

Final spec review found that replacement-level cancellation still depended on collection change detection. Decision snapshots do not expose filenames, so renaming a decision file without changing its bytes produced an equal wildcard snapshot, skipped replacement, and left the old-path identity job live. The exact fail-first moved task, document, and decision files to cosmetic filenames without changing content, published wildcard snapshots, then fired captured old timers with no later event. Task and document survived because their models carry paths; decision failed with expected Adopt shared cache, received undefined. The corrected wildcard rule cancels pending identity jobs for every identity successfully observed before content-equality early return. Empty or missing identities are not cancelled, preserving recovery, and wildcard no-op snapshots still do not poll.

Same-content wildcard verification: filename-only task, document, and decision rename regression passed 50/50 with 600 assertions; complete ContentStore suite passed 10/10 runs with 120 tests and 800 assertions; watcher-enabled MCP milestone blocking regression passed 5/5. Focused ContentStore plus MCP suites passed 45/45 with 207 assertions. bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check . (324 files), bun run build, and git diff --check passed. Authoritative bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 passed 1,649 tests with 2 intentional skips, 0 failures, and 6,748 assertions across 189 files in 173.53s.

Final quality simplification: removed redundant deferred-job cancellation from generic collection replacement helpers. Cancellation now has one responsibility site: successful wildcard reconciliation cancels every present identity before collection-equality evaluation. Verification after cleanup: ContentStore 12/12 and 10x stress 120/120; MCP milestones 33/33 and blocking case 5/5; full isolated suite 1,649 pass, 2 expected skips, 0 fail, 6,748 assertions across 189 files; TypeScript, Biome (324 files), build, and diff-check passed.

PR #759 review follow-up started from exact head cc4de56. The three open review threads are being converted into deterministic fail-first regressions before implementation: wildcard no-op cancellation, fresh same-key retry budget, and sibling preservation during rename/delete.

PR #759 review fail-first fingerprints on cc4de56: (1) null/unrelated wildcard no-op reconciliation reduced three pending targeted jobs to zero; (2) a fresh same-key event observed only three of four required reads before inheriting the old exhausted budget; (3) deleting doc-1 while doc-2 was transiently malformed replaced the document cache with [], and the analogous decision path was next.

Review fixes use one shared identity-targeted rename reconciliation path. A rename event reads its event path when present, otherwise scans only to recover that filename-derived identity, then upserts or deletes only that map entry. Successful same-identity rename evidence cancels stale old-path work even when content is equal; unrelated/null wildcard snapshots no longer cancel targeted jobs. A fresh same-key event replaces a near-exhausted DeferredRecheck token once with a new bounded budget, while synchronous duplicate storms keep one timer/registry entry and remain hard-bounded across at most two budgets.

Final verification after the review fixes: ContentStore 15/15 with 98 assertions; 10x ContentStore stress 150/150; MCP milestones 33/33 with 127 assertions; full bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 1,632 pass, 2 expected interactive skips, 0 fail, 6,696 assertions across 188 files in 166.24s. bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check . (322 files), bun run build, and git diff --check passed.

Post-0acbeb6 spec review identified that an empty collection result cannot distinguish a true filename-derived deletion from a moved target hidden by an unrelated malformed document or decision. Follow-up will use a shared tri-state identity candidate scan and exact no-second-event coverage before changing production code.

Post-0acbeb6 tri-state fail-first evidence: a valid doc-1 moved to `doc-1 - Moved target.md` disappeared when unrelated doc-2 was malformed (expected the new path, received undefined); an incomplete moved TASK-1 was deleted instead of retained and no retry was armed; a separate detached 0acbeb6 decision probe moved decision-1, made unrelated decision-2 guaranteed-invalid, fired only the old-path rename event, and observed decision-1 missing (expected true, received false).

The correction uses one shared filename-filtered identity candidate enumerator for tasks, documents, and decisions. It verifies the root directory before and after enumeration and returns found, authoritatively absent, or incomplete. Only complete zero-candidate results delete; matching unreadable, invalid, or ambiguous candidates preserve the cache and schedule the existing bounded identity retry. Unrelated malformed files are never read. Task recovery retains the custom cross-branch loader fallback only after complete local absence. Deterministic controls prove valid moved identities recover with malformed siblings and no second event, incomplete moved identities recover after one deferred timer round without a second event, and subsequent real deletion still removes only the target while preserving cached siblings.

Final tri-state verification: ContentStore 17/17 with 117 assertions; 10x ContentStore stress 170/170; MCP milestones 33/33 with 127 assertions; full bun test --isolate --timeout=10000 1,634 pass, 2 expected interactive skips, 0 fail, 6,715 assertions across 188 files in 180.74s. bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check . (322 files), bun run build, and git diff --check passed.

Final independent review of commit 1857580 approved the whole diff. Specification verification passed focused ContentStore/MCP 50/50, ContentStore stress 170/170, MCP blocking 5/5, TypeScript, Biome, and diff checks. Quality verification passed ContentStore stress 170/170 and MCP milestones 33/33 with no remaining findings. The three PR review concerns are covered by deterministic wildcard-isolation, fresh bounded-budget, identity-targeted rename/delete, malformed-sibling recovery, and true-deletion tests.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Completed the watcher reconciliation repair with fail-closed identity recovery. Rename/delete handling now enumerates and reads only filename candidates for the affected task, document, or decision and distinguishes found, authoritatively absent, and incomplete results. Malformed unrelated siblings cannot cause deletion; incomplete moved targets remain cached and retry without another watcher event; complete absence still performs real deletion. This retains wildcard isolation, stale-path cancellation, bounded fresh-event retry budgets, cross-branch task fallback, and root/disposal guards. Final verification passed 1,634 tests with 2 expected skips and 0 failures, 10x ContentStore stress, MCP milestones, TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff checks.
