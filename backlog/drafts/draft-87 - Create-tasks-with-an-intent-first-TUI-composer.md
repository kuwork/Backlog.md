## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Deliver the production first slice of an intent-first Blessed task composer. The TUI should support deliberate capture and review using the canonical task and draft paths, without changing default semantics in the CLI, MCP adapter, or shared core.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The board exposes a discoverable task-creation command and the TUI help identifies its shortcut and purpose.
- [x] #2 The first slice presents Title, multiline Description, Status, Type, and Priority, using configured choices and supporting the existing unset behavior where the corresponding public task field permits it.
- [x] #3 The resting Status value is the first configured workflow status; it never defaults to the focused column or to Draft.
- [x] #4 Draft appears as an extra first option only after the user actively opens or changes Status; merely opening the selector does not select Draft, and leaving the field unchanged preserves the first configured workflow status.
- [x] #5 Explicit Create is the only persistence point: a normal status uses the canonical task-creation path, while explicitly selecting Draft uses the canonical draft-creation path.
- [x] #6 Cancel exits without creating or modifying any task or draft.
- [x] #7 Validation and persistence errors are shown without partial writes and preserve all entered values for correction or retry.
- [x] #8 After success, the board refreshes once and focuses the created task when visible; draft or filtered-out results receive honest confirmation that explains why no task is focused.
- [x] #9 Rendered keyboard QA covers discovery, entry, selection, review, creation, cancellation, errors, focus, and scrolling at normal and narrow terminal sizes.
- [x] #10 Automated tests cover configured field choices, exact default/Draft semantics, canonical task-versus-draft payloads, cancellation, failures, board refresh/focus, filtered results, and watcher behavior.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Classify every current and historical Codex review thread against the current head and reproduce each current actionable finding.
2. Preserve commit signing semantics when creating selected-path commits, execute hooks compatibly with supported Git versions, and restore overwritten prior bytes when a failing hook removes the generated path.
3. Add adversarial regression tests for each integrity boundary and rerun focused tests after every slice.
4. Simplify the final implementation, then run the full test suite, TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff review before finalizing the task and requesting a fresh Codex review.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
A disposable Blessed prototype proved the modal, keyboard, refresh, focus, filtered-result, validation, cancellation, and persistence-error mechanics at 100x30, 80x24, and 50x18. Its title/status-only scope and focused-column status default were research choices, not approved production behavior; the acceptance criteria above supersede them. The older 6038cd5 implementation remains research only. Future execution must research the current code and record a fresh plan after activation.

Implemented a single Blessed composer model behind the N shortcut and documented it in the footer and board help. The composer captures Title, multiline Description, Status, Type, and Priority, uses configured choices with explicit unset values, keeps the first configured workflow status at rest, and exposes Draft only in the opened Status picker. Persistence stays on Core.createTaskFromInput for both tasks and drafts. Validation and persistence failures retain values for retry; cancel performs no write. Successful tasks are upserted once and focused when visible, while drafts and filtered tasks receive explicit explanations. Added focused coverage for defaults, Draft semantics, payloads, canonical task and draft persistence, retry state, watcher reconciliation, board focus outcomes, filtered outcomes, and help discovery. Rendered PTY QA passed at 100x30, 80x24, and 50x18 for discovery, multiline entry and scrolling, configured selectors, normal and Draft creation, validation recovery, visible focus, filtered confirmation, and cancellation. Full bun test passed. TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff checks passed.

Specification corrections completed. Core creation now compensates the newly written task or draft and its exact staged Git path when post-write auto-commit fails; an actual failing pre-commit hook proves no task remains, form values survive, and retry reuses TASK-1 without creating TASK-2. Board subscription updates are queued while creation is active, equivalent delayed snapshots are ignored, and rendering is coalesced so real integration tests observe exactly one immediate screen render with TASK-2 focused for watcher delivery before persistence resolves, before composer closure, and after board success. The actual composer Cancel action was exercised and performed zero writes. Layout now uses the real terminal dimensions: the full 100x30 form receives enough height for Create, Cancel, help, and chrome, while 80x24 and 50x18 use compact controls and width-appropriate help. Fresh tmux captures verified all three dimensions and board help discovery for N. Focused composer and help coverage passes 17 tests with 64 assertions. The full bun test suite, bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check pass.

The final focused run includes the created-task focus assertions and passes 17 tests with 67 assertions.

Quality corrections implemented with ownership-safe compensation and path-limited auto-commit. Slow failing hooks no longer allow rollback to delete later edits, pre-existing bytes are restored when safe, and task/draft creation preserves unrelated staged contents and index state on success and failure. The actual composer now cancels with Esc from all seven focusable controls, removes its resize handler on close, reflows live between full and compact layouts, and does not render on close before the board render. Board task-creation flags and queued watcher state always unwind through finally, including composer setup rejection. Focused validation passes 66 tests with 232 assertions across composer, auto-commit, CLI create, and Git operations; TypeScript and Biome pass.

Final quality validation: the full suite passes 1,730 tests with 4 intentional interactive skips and 0 failures (7,297 assertions). Fresh rendered PTY QA on one open composer passes 100x30 → 80x24 → 50x18 → 100x30 with fields, actions, help, and chrome visible throughout. After final self-review, focused coverage passes 66 tests with 232 assertions; TypeScript, Biome, build, and git diff --check pass.

Final re-review identified exact prior-index restoration, empty-project board startup, and safe bounded retry as remaining work. The required Claude loop-breaker was run with the full HEAD/index/worktree scenario and proposed index-info design. It remained silent beyond four minutes and returned only Execution error when stopped once, so no advisory was available and it was not retried. Implementation proceeds from direct Git-state evidence and ownership checks.

Final re-review corrections are complete. Exact per-path index entries and working-tree bytes are snapshotted independently and restored only when the generated state is still owned. Task auto-commit retries remain bounded to three path-limited attempts and stop immediately when the file or index entry changes. Unfiltered empty kanban projects now enter the board and can create their first task, while task-list and parent-filter empty-result messages remain unchanged. Fresh rendered CLI QA created TASK-1 from an empty 80x24 board using N, title entry, five Tabs, and Enter; the created task stayed selected, opened in details, and the board remained usable at 50x18. This QA exposed and fixed an inactive Blessed textarea cancel crash, with the exact keyboard path now covered. Final focused coverage passes 32 tests with 142 assertions. The full suite passes 1,734 tests with 4 intentional interactive skips and 0 failures (7,317 assertions across 196 files in 183.01 seconds). TypeScript, Biome, build, and git diff --check pass.

Final publication verification: 64 focused tests passed across the TUI composer, help, empty-board loading, auto-commit, CLI commit behavior, atomic creation, and Git operations. TypeScript, Biome, build, and git diff --check also passed. Earlier fresh rendered PTY QA verified discovery, data entry, selectors, creation, cancellation, retry, focus, scrolling, and live resize at 100x30, 80x24, and 50x18.

Codex review repair: path-limited commits now build from the owned staged entries in an isolated temporary index, so later worktree bytes are not committed and unrelated staged work remains untouched. Failed hooks that modify the generated task preserve those bytes and return actionable recovery guidance instead of deleting user data. TUI submission reloads autoCommit at create time, and Git path assertions normalize Windows separators. Validation passed: 35 focused composer/unified-view tests, 63 broader Git/auto-commit/milestone tests, full suite 1,737 passed with 4 intentional interactive skips, bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check.

Maintainer decision: if rollback discovers that Backlog no longer owns the same-path staged entry, preserve both the task file and staged Git state, report the exact path and task ID, and require manual Git review before retrying. The task ID remains occupied so later creation allocates the next ID. Added adversarial coverage where concurrent staged bytes differ while the worktree still matches Backlog's generated file, proving cleanup removes neither state.

Approved rollback verification passed. The same-path ownership-loss regression preserves the original task file and independently changed staged blob, reports the exact path, TASK-1 identity, and required manual Git review, and proves the next task allocation is TASK-2. Focused adversarial verification passed 84 tests across composer, unified view, auto-commit, CLI commit behavior, atomic creation, Git operations, and milestone mutations. Final repository verification passed 1,746 tests with 4 intentional interactive skips and 0 failures (7,367 assertions across 196 files); bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check passed.

Current-head Codex review ae04e2d3 identified three P2 integrity/compatibility findings: commit-tree bypasses commit.gpgSign, git hook run requires Git 2.36, and rollback does not restore overwritten prior bytes when the generated path was deleted. Alex has approved preserving worktree and staged state whenever ownership is lost; the current repair will address only clear review findings without changing that policy.

Current-head review repairs implemented. Selected-path commits now honor commit.gpgSign with commit-tree -S while preserving configured signing format and key. Hook execution uses git hook run --ignore-missing on Git 2.36+ and a core.hooksPath-aware Git shell fallback on older versions, with the temporary index and noninteractive editor environment preserved. Rollback now exclusively recreates prior same-path bytes when a failing hook deletes the generated path, without overwriting a concurrent recreation. Focused adversarial verification passes 42 tests with 191 assertions, including a real SSH-signed auto-commit, simulated Git 2.35 hook execution, and task/draft restoration across distinct HEAD, index, and worktree bytes.

Final current-head verification passed: 111 focused tests across composer, unified state, auto-commit, CLI commit behavior, atomic creation, Git operations, and milestone commits; full suite 1,750 passed with 4 intentional skips and 0 failures (7,383 assertions across 196 files); bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check passed.

Remote Ubuntu CI exposed a high-load race in the new deleted-path regression: the ID glob lookup could miss an exact pre-existing target before save, so rollback had no previousContent snapshot to restore even though save overwrote that deterministic target. The repair will derive and snapshot the exact write destination directly before persistence, while retaining ambiguity checks and different-title restoration.

CI race repair complete. Core now snapshots the deterministic task or draft destination directly before persistence and falls back to ID resolution only for different-title prior files; FileSystem uses the same write-target resolver for path calculation and writes. The deleted-path task/draft regression passed 40 repeated isolated runs, the expanded focused suite passed 154 tests, and the full current-head suite passed 1,750 tests with 4 intentional skips and 0 failures (7,383 assertions). TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff checks passed.

Remote Ubuntu CI still reproduces the same-path deletion rollback failure on GitHub's merge result, so the task is reopened while that integration-only failure is investigated.

Linux diagnosis complete: the regression setup created a lower-case TASK-1 file before ID allocation, so the canonical allocator correctly reserved that ID and created TASK-2. The task assertions passed accidentally on macOS but the deletion hook removed the untouched TASK-1 fixture on Linux. The tests now create the competing same-path state immediately after allocation, which exercises the intended allocation-to-write race on every platform. Five focused rollback cases passed repeatedly in Bun 1.3.14's Debian image with the same isolation and concurrency flags as CI.

Fresh Codex review on current head found five additional Git integrity concerns covering in-progress operations, hook index semantics, index snapshot timing, and signing-test argument transport. The task is reopened while those findings are validated and repaired.

Fresh-review repairs complete. Selected-path commits now refuse active merge, rebase, cherry-pick, and revert states; freeze commit content after pre-commit but before message hooks; and run post-commit against the real index. Creation snapshots prior index ownership before publishing task bytes, preventing staged phantoms if another actor stages the new path immediately after publication. The SSH signing regression now passes an empty key passphrase through explicit argv. New merge-state, hook-phase, real-index post-commit, task/draft snapshot-race, and signing regressions pass on macOS and Bun 1.3.14 Debian. Focused integration coverage, TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff checks pass; full suite: 1,755 passed, 4 intentional skips, 0 failed, 7,414 assertions across 196 files.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Completed the intent-first TUI task composer and hardened canonical task and draft creation against concurrent HEAD, index, hook, and worktree changes. Selected-path auto-commits preserve unrelated staged work, configured commit signing, and hooks on both modern and pre-2.36 Git. Failed creation snapshots and restores exact prior owned state, preserves user changes whenever ownership is lost, and reports the occupied task ID and exact recovery path. Also reloads autoCommit on submission and synchronizes first-task board state immediately. Verified through rendered keyboard QA recorded above, 154 focused integration tests, 40 repeated deleted-path recovery runs, the full 1,750-test suite with 0 failures, TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff checks.
