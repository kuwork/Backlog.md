## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The backlog.md domain points to this README, so it effectively is the product landing page. Today it opens with a generic feature list and buries the core pitch. Per Alex's current framing, the durable value proposition is: agents produce more work than humans can read, and Backlog.md is the tool that makes that work reviewable before execution (tasks/AC/milestones as review checkpoints) and legible after (task history as a ledger of intent). Rework the README to lead with that story, add landing-page elements (badges, social proof, talk videos), and tighten the structure without losing reference content.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 README opens with a hero: logo/title, one-sentence value prop centered on reviewing and steering AI agent work, install one-liner, and demo visual
- [x] #2 npm version, downloads, and license badges are present with correct links
- [x] #3 A section explains the core loop with the 3 review checkpoints (spec, plan, code) and one-task-one-context-window guidance, placed before deep reference content
- [x] #4 At least one talk video (Devoxx or AI Engineer Code Summit) is linked as social proof
- [x] #5 Every command and feature mentioned exists in the shipped CLI/MCP surface (no invented behavior)
- [x] #6 Existing reference sections (MCP setup, configuration, CLI reference, community tools, license) are preserved or consolidated without information loss
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Draft reworked README: hero (logo, badges, tagline, install, GIF), inverted pitch (agents outproduce review bandwidth; Backlog.md = review surface before + ledger after), compact 'stay in control' loop with 3 review checkpoints linking to existing workflow steps
2. Add shields.io badges: npm version, npm downloads, GitHub stars, MIT license
3. Add Talks section with Devoxx Belgium and AI Engineer Code Summit video links as social proof
4. Preserve all reference sections (getting started, AI/manual workflows, web UI, MCP, CLI ref, config, community tools, license); verify every mentioned command against backlog --help
5. Run multi-agent critique (landing-page lens, accuracy-vs-shipped-surface lens, skeptical-newcomer lens); revise draft
6. Check ACs, add implementation notes
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Ran a 6-agent critique/ideation workflow. Accuracy agent verified all links/badges/assets/commands against the shipped CLI surface (all 200/exist); flagged task-prefix inconsistency (fixed: README now explains BACK- vs TASK- prefix) and missing Cursor client guide (fixed: added Cursor entry pointing at manual JSON config). Skeptic agent flagged overclaims; applied: dropped 'Proof it works: ~99%' in favor of 'Dogfooded' + link to the backlog/tasks ledger, reframed 'agents rarely fail' to attention-economics framing, replaced '100% private' with 'Local-first (no server/account/telemetry)', removed adjective fluff, neutralized the 95% talk headline. Landing-page agent: thesis line added to hero, hero install reduced to one command, blockquote deduped against Why section, talks surfaced right after Why, features trimmed 13 to 9, config section compressed (full detail already in ADVANCED-CONFIG.md), MCP manual config collapsed into details, workflow sections promoted to h2. Info moved (not lost): --modified-file search and comment-delimiter caveat now in CLI-INSTRUCTIONS.md. DoD: no TypeScript touched; markdown-only change, Biome does not process md; no tests affected. Left In Progress pending Alex's review of the working-tree diff (nothing committed).

Review feedback from Alex (checkpoint 3): remove all em dashes. Applied across README.md by rewriting each occurrence naturally (colons for list leads and checkpoint labels, periods or semicolons for sentence breaks, comma splices where flow allowed); also replaced the en dash in the License line. Verified zero em/en dashes remain via grep. PDF regenerated and redelivered.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Reworked README.md as a landing page: hero with logo/badges/thesis line, 'Why Backlog.md in the AI era' section with the 3 review checkpoints and ledger framing, dogfooding proof linking to the task ledger, talk videos as social proof, trimmed feature list, compressed config/MCP reference sections (details preserved in ADVANCED-CONFIG.md / CLI-INSTRUCTIONS.md / collapsible blocks). Verified all commands, links, badges, and assets against the shipped surface via critique agents.

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
