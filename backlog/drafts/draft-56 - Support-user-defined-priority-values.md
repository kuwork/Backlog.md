## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
GitHub issue #732 requests configurable task priority values beyond the built-in high/medium/low set, for example Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low. Backlog.md should allow a project to define its priority list in configuration while preserving the current default priorities for existing projects.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Projects can configure an ordered list of task priorities, and existing projects without configuration continue to use high, medium, low.
- [x] #2 CLI create, edit, list, search, help text, and task wizard accept and display configured priority values case-insensitively.
- [x] #3 MCP task schemas and handlers expose and validate configured priority values instead of a fixed high/medium/low enum.
- [x] #4 Web task filters and task editing surfaces use the configured priority list and reject unsupported priority filters consistently.
- [x] #5 Priority parsing, sorting, and statistics handle configured priority values without dropping custom priorities.
- [x] #6 Regression tests cover a custom priority list with values beyond high/medium/low.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Merge origin/main through #741/#744 and preserve hierarchical task-ID sorting, creation-date sorting, and custom-priority behavior/tests.
2. Fetch the advanced origin/main at 219f733 and merge it normally, preserving deterministic label-order behavior/tests without rebasing or force-pushing.
3. Run custom-priority, TaskList, TaskColumn, task-sorting, label-order, and board-adjacent focused tests; then type-check, Biome, and build.
4. Review/simplify the final merged result, update BACK-530 notes and final summary, return it to Done, push, and verify the remote SHA.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented custom priority configuration across config parsing, core validation, CLI/help/search/list/edit flows, MCP schemas/handlers, server API filters, statistics, TUI/web filters, display, and sorting. Parser now preserves arbitrary stored priorities, while write/filter paths validate against the configured ordered list.

Validation passed: bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build; bun test src/test/search-command-query.test.ts src/test/cli-priority-filtering.test.ts; bun test (1453 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail).

PR #743 review follow-up started from 1dea690: addressing completion quoting, Web URL canonicalization, and configured priority None statistics collision in a dedicated clean worktree.

PR #743 review follow-up completed. Bash completion now preserves newline-delimited multi-word priorities as single candidates with Bash 3.2-compatible syntax in both committed and embedded scripts. Board and All Tasks canonicalize configured priority URL values case-insensitively after config loads and clear unsupported values without invalid searches. Statistics now stores missing priorities in noPriorityCount, leaving configured None and other custom values distinct.

Validation: bun test src/commands/completion.test.ts src/test/statistics.test.ts src/test/web-board-filters.test.tsx src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx (32 pass, 0 fail); bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build; compiled-binary Bash completion smoke test on Bash 3.2.

PR #743 conflict-resolution follow-up started from 27a2390; merging current main after #741/#744 without rebasing or force-pushing.

PR #743 conflict resolution completed against origin/main 6226251. TaskList now uses the shared hierarchical ascending/descending ID comparators while retaining configured priority filtering, display, and ranking. TaskColumn retains configured priority ordering through the shared reorder emitter and includes #744 oldest/newest creation-date actions. Added a direct custom-priority TaskColumn regression and included availablePriorities in TaskList sort memo dependencies.

Merge validation: bun test src/commands/completion.test.ts src/test/priority.test.ts src/test/statistics.test.ts src/test/task-sorting.test.ts src/test/web-board-filters.test.tsx src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx src/test/web-task-column-sort.test.tsx (79 pass, 0 fail); bun test src/web/lib/lanes.test.ts src/test/board.test.ts src/test/board-ui.test.ts (27 pass, 0 fail); bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build.

origin/main advanced to 219f733 after the first merge push; continuing with a second normal merge so the final PR head includes deterministic label ordering.

Integrated the advanced origin/main at 219f733 with a second normal merge. Resolved the sole TaskList test-harness conflict by combining availableLabels and availablePriorities options, retaining deterministic locale-independent label sorting, hierarchical ID tests, and custom-priority URL tests in the same suite.

Final validation: bun test src/commands/completion.test.ts src/test/priority.test.ts src/test/statistics.test.ts src/test/task-sorting.test.ts src/test/label-filter.test.ts src/test/task-search-label-filter.test.ts src/test/web-board-filters.test.tsx src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx src/test/web-task-column-sort.test.tsx (90 pass, 0 fail); bun test src/web/lib/lanes.test.ts src/test/board.test.ts src/test/board-ui.test.ts (27 pass, 0 fail); label-filter tests pass under en_US.UTF-8, sv_SE.UTF-8, and tr_TR.UTF-8; bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Completed configurable priority support and its Bash/Web/statistics fixes, then merged current main through 219f733 without rebasing or force-pushing. The final branch preserves hierarchical All Tasks ID sorting, board creation-date sorting, locale-independent deterministic label ordering, and all custom-priority behavior; focused tests, locale checks, TypeScript, Biome, and build pass.
<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
