## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Codex finding on PR #916 (BACK-634), pre-existing class, confirmed as the root cause blocking BACK-639 (PR #940, seven review cycles): drafts have a dual identity model (filename-derived vs frontmatter-declared) with zero-padding and dotted-segment variants that different consumers interpret differently; first-match loadDraft can rewrite or promote a different same-ID draft than the one the user saw. Agreed design: the canonical draft identity is filename-derived and canonicalized in exactly one shared function (per-segment numeric canonicalization covering padding and dotted segments); frontmatter id must canonically agree with the filename id or every mutation path fails closed with actionable repair copy naming the file; duplicate numeric identities across files are ambiguous everywhere mutations resolve them; unparsable files are never silently deleted or overwritten and their filename ids still count as occupied for allocation. Tasks, documents, and decisions already fail closed (AmbiguousTaskIdError / BACK-580); drafts get the same treatment across CLI, TUI, web, and MCP.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Draft resolution fails closed with an error naming candidate files when multiple drafts share an identity
- [ ] #2 Web and MCP draft edit/promote paths surface the conflict instead of mutating an arbitrary match
- [ ] #3 doctor reports duplicate draft identities
- [ ] #4 CLI draft view, web GET, and MCP draft fetch fail closed on duplicate identity using the same resolver as edit
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [ ] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [ ] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Collapse find-by-id onto resolveDraftFilePath: loadDraft becomes a thin wrapper (resolve path, then loadDraftFromFile) that rethrows AmbiguousIdError. Delete getDraftPath so it cannot first-match.
2. CLI draft view and draft [id] load through loadDraft and catch AmbiguousIdError like document view. CLI draft archive catches the same error as draft promote.
3. Web GET /api/tasks/DRAFT-* maps AmbiguousIdError to 409. MCP task_view already uses loadDraft plus the existing error mapper.
4. TUI editTaskInTui id-only lookup catches AmbiguousIdError and returns reason ambiguous; the selected-row path already fail-closes.
5. Core create previous-path lookup uses filesystem.resolveDraftFilePath instead of getDraftPath.
6. Tests: draft-1 plus draft-001 fail closed on CLI view, CLI edit, web GET, and MCP fetch (files named, neither changed). Unique drafts still view and edit. Existing mutation fail-closed tests stay. Replace twin first-match loadDraft assertions with file reads.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Started on tasks/back-636-draft-identity stacked on 46d2cd5e (BACK-639 stack preserved per plan step 1). Folding six round-7 findings into the validated-reference foundation plus canonicalization authority, doctor coverage, and web/MCP conflict regression tests.

BACK-636 implementation notes (stacked on BACK-639 @46d2cd5e). FOUNDATION: one canonicalization authority - utils/task-path.ts draftIdentityKey(id) canonicalizes prefix casing and strips leading zeros in EVERY numeric segment incl. dotted subtask segments; draftIdsMatchLoosely now compares through it, findDuplicateDraftFilenameGroups keys through it, and saveDraft convergence + resolveDraftFilePath/resolveDraftReference candidates inherit it via draftIdsMatchLoosely/filenameMatchesId; redundant extractDraftBody deleted. ROUND-7 FINDINGS: (1) dotted padding variants (draft-1.1 vs draft-1.01) now group as one identity - picker guard and direct-ID resolution both fail closed naming both files, no data loss (test asserts both files survive); (2) absolute paths passed as public draft edit argument are rejected unless inside the configured drafts dir ('Invalid draft id' error), foreign/task-shaped files cannot be copied into drafts; (3) TUI close-time task reload attaches known taskFilePath so contentStore.upsertTask publishes and cached reads stop going stale; (4) TUI pre-open duplicate check over ALL filenames returns new 'ambiguous' reason when selected row shares numeric identity, handled in both TUI handlers with rename guidance; (5) draft edit help schema now lists all supported fields matching addEditFieldOptions, verified by --help completeness test; (6) promotion wraps read-unlink span in withDraftLock before createLock (consistent ordering, no deadlock) - contended promotion fails fast TaskLockError with single record preserved, succeeds after release. B fail-closed agreement audit: promote (core+fs) bind by filename resolver, no loadDraft first-match on any mutation path; remaining loadDraft/getDraftPath uses are read-only surfaces (view/list/default, web GET, MCP fetch) or allocator-fresh writes. C doctor: FileSystem.diagnoseDraftIdentity + Core delegate report duplicate numeric identities, drifted frontmatter-vs-filename (naming file, frontmatter id, filename id), and unreadable files; printed in doctor output and included in exit-code/healthy checks. D web/MCP regression tests: PUT /api/tasks/DRAFT-1 with a padded twin returns 409 naming both files without mutating either; /api/drafts/:id/promote maps ambiguity to 409 message; MCP task_edit returns isError result containing the ambiguity text with both records untouched. Verification: targeted suites 181 pass across 10 suites; full bun test 2395 pass / 7 skip / 1 pre-existing main failure; tsc clean; biome clean on all touched files (server/index.ts format debt fixed since touched this round).

Round-7 correction fixes (5 P2s): (1) doctor --fix --yes now checks draftIdentityBroken on the post-repair path - mixed task+draft projects exit 1 after repairing task duplicates, reporting 'Draft identity findings remain diagnostic-only'; (2) server promote handler maps TaskLockError to retryable 409 like create-lock/ambiguity errors; (3) listDraftFilenames gained an optional unreadable out-param - directory scan failures surface as 'Unreadable draft files' findings naming the drafts dir so doctor never reports healthy without checking; (4) draft edit help schema adds --clear-ac Boolean alongside the other AC fields; (5) duplicate recovery copy reworded to 'Rename one file to a distinct numeric id, then make its frontmatter agree.' across printer + both AmbiguousIdError guidance sites (frontmatter-only repair cannot resolve filename-derived duplicates). Tests added/updated: doctor mixed task+draft --fix --yes exit code test; doctor unscannable drafts-dir test (chmod-gated scan failure surfaces as finding); web promote 409 under held draft lock; schema completeness includes --clear-ac; copy wording assertions updated. Note: observed pre-existing flaky mcp-tasks search test (spy interference) reproducing on parent commit too - unrelated. Verification: targeted 51 tests across doctor/server/cli-draft-edit pass; full bun test 2398 pass / 1 pre-existing main failure; tsc clean; biome clean except untouched task-composer.ts.

Correction round on 377da47d: (1) path-form draft edit arguments that resolve inside the drafts dir now re-resolve through resolveDraftReference(canonicalId) with a filePath-equality requirement - duplicate pairs fail closed naming files (neither deleted) while unique in-drafts-dir paths still work through the picker channel; (2) doctor drafts-dir unreadable test mirrors the document-directory probe-and-skip pattern (probe scan after chmod; skip diagnostics when chmod cannot block, e.g. root/Windows; restore perms in finally) and the printer copy now reads 'Unreadable draft files or directories' matching the document section. Verified: duplicate-pair path edit asserts ambiguity naming both files with both preserved; lone-file path edit succeeds; unscannable-dir test exercises the locked path on this machine (4 assertions) and degrades to healthy-exit assertion where chmod cannot block.

Round-8 note: six full-stack re-review P1/P2s fixed on top of this task's foundation while stacked under BACK-639 (see BACK-639 notes for details): locked status-promotion path, locked archive span, locked TUI close window with TaskLockError fail-fast, saveDraft unlink-failure abort, soft-collision picker behavior, and file-identity row reconciliation in both TUI callers.

Alex confirmed 2026-08-26: task_prefix=draft is unsupported and must not drive design. Remaining work on this task is one filename-derived finder for every surface, including reads. Mutations already fail closed; loadDraft/getDraftPath first-match on view/GET/MCP fetch still guesses. Unifying tasks/documents/decisions onto one shared helper is a follow-up task, not this PR. Do not add a new service layer.

Reads now use the same filename-derived finder as mutations. loadDraft is a thin wrapper of resolveDraftFilePath + loadDraftFromFile and rethrows AmbiguousIdError. Deleted getDraftPath. CLI draft view / draft [id], web GET, MCP task_view, and TUI id-only edit fail closed naming both files for draft-1 + draft-001 twins; neither file changes. Unique drafts still view and edit. Existing mutation fail-closed tests still pass. bunx tsc --noEmit clean; biome clean on touched files. Targeted draft suites pass. Full bun test 2408 pass / 7 skip / 1 pre-existing config-commands failure on main. Did not start BACK-640 (one helper for tasks/docs/decisions/drafts). Did not add task_prefix=draft handling.

Remaining scope: one draft finder for CLI, TUI, web, and MCP (reads and writes). Prefixing tasks as draft is unsupported. Shared lookup across all entity types is the dependent follow-up, not this PR.
