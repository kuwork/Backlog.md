## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Investigate the current GitHub Actions test workflow and make a careful, evidence-backed change that reduces CI runtime without hiding test failures or making stateful tests flaky.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 CI test workflow uses Bun test execution options that reduce runtime where safe.
- [x] #2 Stateful or interactive tests remain isolated enough to avoid cross-test contamination.
- [x] #3 Local validation exercises the changed test commands or the closest practical equivalent.
- [x] #4 Implementation notes record the timing/risk rationale for the chosen approach.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Use recent GitHub Actions job timings to identify the slow path.
2. Compare Bun test execution options against the pinned CI runtime and reject options that do not preserve suite behavior.
3. Keep file-level isolation for stateful tests and split only the slow Windows unit-test path into deterministic CI shards.
4. Preserve the existing Windows aggregate check name while making it depend on all shard jobs.
5. Rebase the CI speedup on PR #737 and latest main/Bun 1.3.14, then validate install, shard coverage, typecheck, Biome, full tests, and build smoke.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Recent CI timing: lint-and-unit-test is the bottleneck, especially Windows. Recent successful Windows test steps took about 6m10s-6m49s, while Ubuntu/macOS test steps were about 2m21s-3m14s.

Bun flag findings: CI pins Bun 1.3.11. That version supports --isolate and --max-concurrency, but not --parallel or --shard. Local Bun 1.3.14 supports --parallel, but the current suite fails under 1.3.14 with 116 MCP ReferenceError failures, so a runtime bump is not a safe narrow CI speedup.

Implementation: keep Bun 1.3.11 and shard only Windows tests into three separate CI jobs using scripts/list-test-shard.ts. Each shard runs the same isolated Bun command against a disjoint file list. The aggregate lint-and-unit-test (windows-latest) job preserves the old Windows check name while depending on all Windows shards.

Local validation: Bun 1.3.11 unsharded baseline passed in 182.26s. Sharded Bun 1.3.11 runs selected 57 files per shard, covers the same 171 files, and passed sequentially with shard timings 61.17s, 90.56s, and 46.66s. Expected wall-clock test phase is bounded by the slowest shard rather than the sum.

Validation passed: bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; git diff --check; Bun 1.3.11 sharded test validation for all three shards using scripts/list-test-shard.ts.

Final rerun after replacing mapfile with a portable Bash read loop: all three Bun 1.3.11 shards passed again with timings 60.84s, 72.75s, and 37.89s. Re-ran bun run check ., bunx tsc --noEmit, and git diff --check successfully after the final workflow change.

Final workflow review tweak: Windows lint now runs on shard 1 before the shard tests, so the preserved lint-and-unit-test (windows-latest) aggregate still depends on both Windows lint and all Windows unit-test shards. Re-ran bun run check . and git diff --check after this YAML-only change.

Follow-up per request: fast-forwarded branch to origin/main at a806a2c, which already pins CI to BUN_VERSION 1.3.14 and updates workflow actions. Reapplied the Windows sharding patch on top of latest main, aligned the shard job with checkout@v7/cache@v6 and check:types, then validated locally with Bun 1.3.14: bun run check:types passed; bun run check . passed; full non-Windows CI test command passed with 1445 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail across 173 files in 167.47s.

Rebased tasks/back-524-speed-up-ci onto PR #737 (tasks/back-525-browser-bundling-cleanup) and replayed latest main through a806a2c on top of that stack. Resolved the dependency conflicts by preserving PR #737's Bun/Tailwind build path (bun-plugin-tailwind and bun scripts/build.ts) while carrying forward latest main dependency versions, regenerated bun.lock with Bun 1.3.14, regenerated bun.nix through bun run update-nix, and kept src/web/styles/style.css deleted because PR #737 no longer checks in generated CSS.

Post-rebase validation on Bun 1.3.14: bun install --frozen-lockfile --linker=isolated passed; shard helper covers all 173 test files exactly once across three shards (58/58/57); bun run check:types passed; bun run check . passed; full isolated test command passed with 1445 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail across 173 files in 163.86s; CI-style local build smoke using bun scripts/build.ts produced /tmp/backlog-ci-build and --version reported 1.47.1.

Second rebase per request: moved tasks/back-524-speed-up-ci onto updated PR #737 head 765bb22 using git rebase --onto, then reapplied the BACK-524 patch cleanly. Validation on the updated stack: bun install --frozen-lockfile --linker=isolated passed; shard helper still covers all 173 tests exactly once across shards 58/58/57; bun run check:types passed; bun run check . passed; git diff --check passed. Full isolated test run completed with 1444 pass, 2 skip, and one timeout in ContentStore > removes decisions when files are deleted after 187.32s; rerunning src/test/content-store.test.ts directly with the same 10000ms timeout passed all 5 tests in 61ms, indicating an isolated watcher timing flake rather than a deterministic regression.

CI follow-up from main run 28978320635: Windows shard 1/3 failed because CLI Priority Filtering > case insensitive priority filtering kept a hardcoded 10000ms per-test timeout while Windows shards now rely on a 30000ms command timeout. Updated that test to use getPlatformTimeout(10000), preserving the 10s timeout off Windows and giving Windows the standard platform headroom. Verified with bun test src/test/cli-priority-filtering.test.ts --timeout=30000, bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., and git diff --check.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Stacked the CI speedup branch on PR #737 and kept the Windows unit-test speedup as three isolated Bun test shard jobs with an aggregate lint-and-unit-test (windows-latest) check. Preserved PR #737's new Bun/Tailwind build pipeline, aligned the branch with latest main/Bun 1.3.14, and verified with frozen install, exact shard coverage, typecheck, Biome check, full isolated tests (1445 pass, 2 skip), and a CI-style compiled-binary smoke check.
