## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
GitHub issue #733 reports that the Web UI All Tasks Labels dropdown shows labels in creation/configuration order rather than alphabetical order. The browser label filter menu should present labels lexicographically so users can scan and select labels predictably.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The All Tasks Labels dropdown renders available labels in alphabetical/lexicographic order regardless of task creation order.
- [x] #2 Label sorting is case-insensitive and deterministic for configured labels and labels discovered from tasks.
- [x] #3 A Web UI regression test covers unordered input labels rendering alphabetically in the Labels dropdown.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Preserve the locale-independent label collector and its accented/NFC-NFD regression coverage.
2. Merge origin/main with a normal merge commit, retaining BACK-528 shared task-ID sorting behavior and combining both TaskList Web test blocks.
3. Run focused label, TaskList, and task-sorting suites plus TypeScript, Biome, and build without running the full live-worktree suite.
4. Finalize BACK-529, inspect the merge diff/status, commit, and push the existing PR branch.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Reproduced issue #733 with a focused TaskList Web UI test: before the fix, the Labels dropdown rendered zeta before Alpha because available labels preserved insertion order. Updated collectAvailableLabels to sort de-duplicated labels case-insensitively while preserving first-seen casing. Validation passed: bun test src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx src/test/label-filter.test.ts; bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun test (1447 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail).

Reopened to address the confirmed review gap: label ordering must be independent of host locale and input order for canonically equivalent Unicode forms. Full bun test is intentionally excluded in this live worktree because of the known destructive worktree-test interaction.

Replaced the host-default Intl.Collator and localeCompare ordering with locale-independent UTF-16 code-unit comparison over lowercase NFD sort keys, followed by the original label as a raw code-unit tie-breaker. Case-insensitive de-duplication and first-seen spelling remain unchanged.

Added focused coverage for accented ordering across locale expectations, reversed NFC/NFD inputs, and first-seen casing. Validation passed: bun test src/test/label-filter.test.ts src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx (12 pass); label utility tests also passed under en_US.UTF-8 and sv_SE.UTF-8; bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build. The full suite was not run from this live worktree because of the reported destructive worktree-test interaction; GitHub CI will run the full matrix after push.

Reopened for integration after BACK-528 (#741) merged to main. The only content conflict is the shared TaskList Web test insertion point; resolution preserves both the label-order regression and all new hierarchical ID-sort regressions.

Integrated origin/main at 5810c9e after BACK-528 (#741) merged. Resolved the sole content conflict in src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx by retaining the label-order regression plus all three hierarchical/nonnumeric ID-sort regressions. Main TaskList and task-sorting implementation files remain unchanged from origin/main.

Validation passed on the merged tree: bun test src/test/web-task-list-labels-menu.test.tsx src/test/label-filter.test.ts src/test/task-sorting.test.ts src/test/task-search-label-filter.test.ts (46 pass); bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build. The full suite was not run from the live worktree because of the known destructive worktree-test interaction.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Merged current main with a normal merge while preserving BACK-528 hierarchical ID sorting and BACK-529 locale-independent label sorting. Combined both Web TaskList regression blocks without altering main’s ID implementation; 46 focused tests, TypeScript, Biome, and build pass. The full matrix remains delegated to GitHub CI for live-worktree safety.
<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
