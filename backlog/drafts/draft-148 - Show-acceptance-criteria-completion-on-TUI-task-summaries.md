## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Help people understand how much accepted task scope has been verified while scanning in-progress work in the TUI. In-progress task summaries and cards should show a compact completion bar followed by the exact checked/total acceptance-criteria fraction. This is a TUI presentation feature only; it does not change task state or CLI and MCP output.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 In-progress task summaries and cards in the TUI show a compact completion bar followed by the exact checked/total fraction, for example [██████░░░░] 4/7.
- [x] #2 The visible indicator has no AC label and no percentage.
- [x] #3 The completion value is derived live from checked and total acceptance criteria and is not persisted as separate progress state.
- [x] #4 The bar uses 10 cells when available terminal width permits and 5 cells in constrained layouts.
- [x] #5 A task with no acceptance criteria does not display 0% or otherwise imply measurable completion.
- [x] #6 A task with every acceptance criterion checked still retains and clearly presents its actual In Progress status rather than implying that the task is Done.
- [x] #7 Colors are theme-safe, and the bar plus exact fraction remain understandable when color is unavailable.
- [x] #8 CLI and MCP output remain unchanged.
- [x] #9 TUI rendering tests cover partial completion, no acceptance criteria, all criteria checked while still In Progress, and both supported bar widths.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add one pure TUI acceptance-criteria progress formatter that derives checked and total counts from acceptanceCriteriaItems, renders only In Progress tasks, and selects a 10- or 5-cell bar from available row width.
2. Reuse the formatter in board cards and interactive task-list summaries while preserving status, identity, selection, cross-branch styling, and responsive rerendering.
3. Add deterministic rendering tests for partial, empty, fully checked, non-progress, wide, and constrained cases across both summary surfaces.
4. Run focused tests, TypeScript, Biome, build, and unchanged CLI JSON coverage; inspect the final diff for simplification and scope.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented a shared, color-independent TUI formatter that reads acceptanceCriteriaItems live and renders responsive 10-cell or 5-cell completion bars only for In Progress tasks. Board cards and task-list summaries reuse it; progress-bearing list rows use the existing active-status icon so constrained layouts retain task identity.

Verification: 61 focused TUI, board, selection, and CLI JSON tests passed; 32 MCP task tests passed; 4 loopback browser/server tests passed outside the sandbox; bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run build, and git diff --check passed. Rendered PTY QA at 120x30 and 80x24 verified board and list wide/compact bars, uncluttered no-criteria tasks, and fully checked tasks retaining the active status. The full suite attempt also hit the pre-existing TUI watcher timeout, reproduced from unchanged HEAD, plus sandbox-only port binding failures; the port tests passed when rerun with loopback access.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Added a shared responsive acceptance-criteria progress indicator to TUI board cards and task-list summaries. It derives checked/total values directly from each task, uses 10 cells on wide rows and 5 on constrained rows, omits tasks without criteria, and preserves active-status meaning without relying on color. Verified with 93 focused TUI/CLI JSON/MCP tests, 4 loopback server tests, PTY rendering at 120x30 and 80x24, TypeScript, Biome, build, and diff checks.
