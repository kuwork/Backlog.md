## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Common single-task commands currently load the cross-branch corpus and may fetch origin before resolving a local task. On this repository that makes task view and task edit take tens of seconds or hang. Task list is also slower than expected. Preserve fail-closed identity semantics while making local single-task operations bypass cross-branch work and removing avoidable work from task listing.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 backlog task view and the task shorthand resolve and render a unique local task without fetching remotes or enumerating active branches
- [x] #2 backlog task edit resolves and updates a unique local task without fetching remotes or enumerating active branches
- [x] #3 Single-task commands still fail closed for ambiguous local task identities and report missing tasks correctly
- [x] #4 backlog task list performs only the remote and cross-branch work required by configuration without duplicate refreshes or redundant corpus loads
- [x] #5 Focused automated tests assert the Git-operation boundaries for task view, shorthand, edit, and list
- [x] #6 Before-and-after timings on a representative repository demonstrate faster task view, task edit, and task list behavior
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add working-copy active/completed identity resolution that preserves canonical ambiguity without branch loading.
2. Make includeCrossBranch:false load and search local tasks directly, and route CLI view, shorthand, and edit through that path.
3. Preserve the atomic in-lock reread but make it local, and remove the redundant interactive-list corpus load.
4. Add regression tests proving fetch and branch readers are not called while existing cross-branch Core behavior remains.
5. Run focused tests, typecheck, lint, build, and before/after command timings.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Diagnosis: v1.49.0 routed local view/edit through the cross-branch ContentStore; v1.50.0 added a necessary in-lock reread that currently repeats that full scan. includeCrossBranch:false has only filtered results after loading. Backlog lock directories were empty and task locks fail fast; unbounded fetch plus repeated branch indexing is the dominant delay.

Implemented a working-copy active/completed identity resolver for local reads and mutations; includeCrossBranch:false now loads and searches local tasks before ContentStore initialization. CLI view, shorthand, edit, and parent filtering use the local scope; the atomic in-lock reread remains. Removed the interactive list's redundant full load. Consolidated padded/dotted task search variants into one shared helper so local and global search remain aligned.

Validation passed: TypeScript, Biome over 371 files, build, and 178 focused/control tests covering local Git tripwires, CLI branch-only behavior, list/search, custom IDs, task views, Core identity behavior, atomic locks, board/worktree refresh, and cross-branch ContentStore preservation. A broad ContentStore batch also exposed unrelated temporary-worktree watcher timeouts; the relevant cross-branch invariant passed alone.

Same-checkout benchmark, v1.50 to fixed binary: task view 4.42s to 0.85s; task list 4.15s to 0.21s; no-op task edit 12.19s to 0.42s. The old commands attempted remote fetches; the fixed commands did not.

Review fix round: reconciled parent-ID resolution so task create --parent uses the same local active/completed fail-closed resolution as task list --parent and task view, and moved dependency validation onto the same working-copy lookup so it no longer runs a cross-branch load and remote fetch inside the task lock; a parent or dependency that exists only on another branch is now refused on every surface. Local not-found messages (view, shorthand, edit, --parent on list and create, missing dependencies) now name the working copy as the corpus searched and point at the browser view, using a fixed sentence with no branch scanning. Restored the browser default: /api/tasks serves the cross-branch ContentStore again instead of re-globbing the working copy per request, with crossBranch=false still serving the local view. Removed the unused TaskReadOptions parameters from archiveTask, completeTask, demoteTask, and editTaskOrDraft; archive/complete/demote keep their existing cross-branch reads. New pins cover create-parent and dependency locality under the fetch tripwire, fail-closed ambiguity for both, the hint wording across CLI surfaces, and the store-served /api/tasks default; the two tests that pinned cross-branch parent and dependency acceptance were inverted. Gates: tsc, biome (371 files), build, and the full suite at 2201 pass / 6 skip / 0 fail.

Reconciliation went both ways: task list --parent now resolves through the same working-copy lookup as task view and task create --parent, so a completed parent is no longer missing for the filter alone, the filter reads the corpus once instead of twice, and the ambiguity message still names the configured prefix. Full suite after that change: 2203 pass / 6 skip / 0 fail.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Made local task list, view, shorthand, and edit bypass cross-branch fetching and branch enumeration while preserving local ambiguity checks and atomic edit locking. Global cross-branch Core behavior remains available for browser/MCP surfaces. Verified with structural Git-boundary tests, CLI branch-only tests, 178 focused/control tests, typecheck, lint, build, and same-checkout timings.
