## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
GitHub issue #694 asks for a Web board column menu action to sort tasks by creation date. Scope is intentionally narrow: add creation-date sort actions beside the existing Sort by Priority action, using the existing task createdDate field and current column reorder behavior without introducing a generic sorting framework.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Board column menu exposes creation-date sorting beside the existing priority sort action.
- [x] #2 Creation-date sorting supports both oldest-first and newest-first ordering within the selected column.
- [x] #3 Sorting uses each task createdDate and falls back predictably when a task has no created date.
- [x] #4 The change is covered by focused Web board tests.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add a small TaskColumn-local sort helper for creation date ordering, reusing the existing reorder payload flow.
2. Extend the column actions menu with two creation-date actions: oldest first and newest first.
3. Add focused TaskColumn DOM tests for both directions and missing-date fallback behavior.
4. Run the Web column test, type-check, Biome, and relevant broader tests.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Reproduced issue #694 by rendering TaskColumn with multiple tasks and opening the column menu; the only menu item is "Sort by Priority", with no creation-date sort action.

Implemented two TaskColumn menu actions for creation-date sorting: oldest first and newest first. Both actions reuse the existing column reorder payload flow and keep missing/invalid created dates at the end with task ID as the deterministic tie-breaker.

Validation passed: DOM reproduction now shows Sort by Priority, Sort by Creation Date (oldest first), and Sort by Creation Date (newest first); bun test src/test/web-task-column-sort.test.tsx; bunx tsc --noEmit; bun run check .; bun run build; bun test src/test/web-task-column-sort.test.tsx src/web/lib/lanes.test.ts src/test/board.test.ts src/test/board-ui.test.ts; bun test (1449 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail).

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Added creation-date sorting to the Web board column menu using the existing reorder behavior. Users can sort a column oldest-first or newest-first; missing created dates sort last and ties fall back to task ID. Added focused TaskColumn tests for both directions and fallback behavior.

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->
