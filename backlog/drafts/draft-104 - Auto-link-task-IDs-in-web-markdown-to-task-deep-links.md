## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Task IDs mentioned in prose (descriptions, plans, implementation notes, comments, final summaries, documents, decisions) render as plain text in the Web UI, so following a reference means copying the ID and searching for it.

This task takes over community PR #812 by @cottrell (https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md/pull/812), which added the feature: bare task IDs in markdown become links to /tasks/<id>, and dependency chips in the task details sidebar become clickable links. The fork PR is stale (base ~100 commits behind), its own Backlog task ID collides with an existing BACK-555 on main, and review found two defects that must be fixed before this can ship:

1. Over-broad detection. The matcher used a generic letters-dash-digits pattern with no check against real tasks, so it linkified UTF-8, ISO-8601, version strings, and the tail of longer identifiers (my-task-123 linked task-123). Detection must be constrained to real task identity, and a leading boundary must prevent partial matches inside longer identifiers.
2. Code blocks were not excluded. The guard counted backticks on the current line only, so fenced code blocks were still linkified even though the PR claimed to exclude them. Inline code and fenced blocks must both be reliably excluded.

Related: BACK-239 covers the same idea for documents and decisions plus backlinks; this task is the task-ID half only and should leave a mechanism BACK-239 can extend.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Bare task IDs that match a known task render as links to /tasks/<id> in web markdown fields (description, plan, notes, comments, final summary, documents, decisions)
- [x] #2 Task IDs inside inline code spans and fenced code blocks are not linkified
- [x] #3 Non-task tokens such as UTF-8, ISO-8601 and v1.2.3, and longer identifiers whose tail looks like a task ID such as my-task-123, are not linkified
- [x] #4 Task IDs inside existing markdown links keep their original link target
- [x] #5 Dependency chips in the task details sidebar link to the referenced task
- [x] #6 Web component tests cover linking, code-block exclusion, non-task tokens, and dependency chip links
- [x] #7 Following a task link from the task details modal with unsaved edits asks for confirmation before leaving, for both dependency chips and auto-linked IDs in markdown
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Take over PR #812 by cherry-picking cottrell's two source commits (MermaidMarkdown auto-link, DependencyInput chip links) onto a branch off current main, excluding his colliding back-555 task file.
2. Move detection from string-level regex over raw markdown to the markdown AST: add a small remark plugin (src/web/utils/task-id-links.ts) that walks mdast text nodes and rewrites task-ID matches into link nodes. Code fences and inline code carry no text children, so they are excluded structurally; link/linkReference subtrees are skipped so existing links keep their target.
3. Validate candidates against the task corpus the web UI already loads: build a canonical-ID index (canonicalTaskId from src/utils/task-id.ts) in a small TaskIdIndexProvider fed by App state, consumed by MermaidMarkdown. Unknown tokens (UTF-8, ISO-8601, v1.2.3) never link, and no new API call is added.
4. Add leading/trailing boundary rules so IDs embedded in longer identifiers (my-task-123, BACK-1.md) are not matched.
5. Keep dependency chips as react-router links, but only when the referenced task exists in the loaded corpus.
6. Extend src/test/mermaid-markdown.test.tsx and add a DependencyInput test; run tsc, biome, and the full test suite.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Takeover of PR #812 by David Cottrell (@cottrell). His two source commits were cherry-picked with authorship preserved (`git cherry-pick -x`), so the original work is in the branch history:
- b834302d "Auto-link task IDs in markdown fields to deep links" (MermaidMarkdown + first two tests)
- c56de5d9 "Make dependencies chips clickable deep links to /tasks/:id" (DependencyInput)
His `back-555` task file and the plan/finalize commits were excluded: that ID already belongs to a different task on main.

What survived from the original: the feature idea and its shape (bare IDs become `/tasks/<id>` links, dependency chips become router links), the DependencyInput chip Link, and the two original test cases (kept, with stronger assertions).

What was rewritten and why:
1. Detection moved from a string rewrite of the raw markdown to a small remark plugin over the mdast (`src/web/utils/task-id-links.ts`). The original counted backticks on the current line, so ``` fenced blocks were still linkified, contradicting the PR own acceptance criterion. In the AST, `code` and `inlineCode` nodes carry no text children, so both forms of code are excluded by construction rather than by guesswork, and `link`/`linkReference` subtrees are skipped so existing links keep their target.
2. Candidates are now validated against real tasks. `TaskIdIndexProvider` (src/web/contexts/TaskIdIndexContext.tsx) builds a canonical-ID index from the task corpus App already loads and passes to the modal, so no new API call and no extra fetch; `canonicalTaskId` from src/utils/task-id.ts makes `back-123`, `BACK-0123` and `BACK-123` resolve to the same task and the link always uses the canonical ID. Unknown ID-shaped tokens (UTF-8, ISO-8601, BACK-9999) never link.
3. Boundary rules replace `\b`: a candidate preceded by [A-Za-z0-9_-/.] or followed by an identifier character or a file extension is rejected, so `my-task-123`, `backlog/tasks/TASK-123` and `BACK-1.md` stay plain.
4. Dependency chips link only when the referenced task is in the loaded corpus; unknown dependencies stay plain text instead of pointing at a route that cannot resolve.

Tradeoffs recorded for review:
- Auto-links render as plain anchors, like hand-written markdown links in this component, so following one is a full page load rather than a client-side route change. Chips keep client-side navigation. Making markdown links client-side would require a Router in MermaidMarkdown and its tests; not worth it for a localhost UI.
- When the task corpus is empty (initial load, or MermaidMarkdown rendered outside the provider) nothing is linkified. Failing closed was preferred over emitting links that may not resolve.
- The provider wrapper in App.tsx was added without re-indenting the 120-line JSX block it wraps, to keep the diff reviewable.

Verification:
- bunx tsc --noEmit and bun run check . clean.
- bun test src/test/mermaid-markdown.test.tsx (12 pass) and src/test/web-dependency-input-links.test.tsx (2 pass).
- Live check against this repo through `backlog browser`: task BACK-593 description rendered BACK-555/BACK-239/back-555 as /tasks/ links while UTF-8, ISO-8601, v1.2.3 and my-task-123 stayed plain; a scratch document confirmed a fenced block and an inline code span containing BACK-239 were not linkified while the same ID in prose was; clicking an auto-link opened the target task, and the BACK-544 dependency chip navigated to BACK-543.

Full verification run: bun run test -> 1955 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail across 215 files; bunx tsc --noEmit clean; bun run check . clean; bun run build produced dist/backlog.

Review follow-up (PR #865, five accepted Codex findings):

1. P1 unsaved-edit loss. Chip and prose links both left the task without passing the modal unsaved-changes confirmation. Fixed with one guard instead of two: TaskDetailsModal now handles clicks in the capture phase over its content grid, and when the form is in edit or create mode with unsaved changes it asks "Discard unsaved changes and leave this task?" before any in-modal link navigates. Declining cancels the event, which stops the react-router chip Link and the plain markdown anchor alike, so the full page load that would discard edits never starts. Same-page anchors (markdown heading links), new-tab clicks (modifier or target), and non-http schemes are exempt, and preview mode is untouched so inline title editing does not prompt spuriously.
   Chosen over a beforeunload guard: the capture guard covers exactly the paths these links create, reuses the existing confirmation wording, and does not change reload or tab-close behaviour for the rest of the app. beforeunload remains absent, as before this change.
2. P2 canonical collisions. buildTaskIdIndex now drops a canonical ID when two loaded tasks share it (BACK-1 and BACK-01), instead of keeping the last writer, matching resolveTaskById refusing to guess between ambiguous IDs.
3. P2 chip identity. Dependency chips resolve through the shared index and canonicalTaskId instead of strict id equality, so dependencies differing in case or zero padding link to the right task, and ambiguous IDs stay plain. The index now maps canonical ID to the task, so chip label, chip href and markdown href all come from one resolution path.
4. P2 legacy IDs. The candidate pattern widened to the shapes isValidTaskId accepts, including non-numeric bodies such as TASK-PREFIXED. Corpus validation stays fail-closed, so a wider pattern cannot produce false links; it also swallows whole hyphenated identifiers, which keeps my-task-123 plain for a better reason than before.
5. P2 Unicode boundaries. Boundary tests use \p{L}\p{N}\p{M} classes against short slices rather than single UTF-16 units, so cafeBACK-123 and BACK-123 followed by a non-ASCII letter stay plain.

Review-fix verification: 16 tests in src/test/mermaid-markdown.test.tsx, 4 in src/test/web-dependency-input-links.test.tsx, and a new src/test/web-task-details-modal-unsaved-navigation.test.tsx (4 tests, real DOM + react-router, covering decline-blocks-chip, accept-navigates, decline-blocks-comment-autolink, and no prompt when nothing is unsaved). Full suite 1965 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail across 216 files; bunx tsc --noEmit and bun run check . clean.
Live browser pass of the P1 flow against this repo: on BACK-544 in edit mode with an unsaved title, clicking the BACK-543 dependency chip prompted once and stayed put with the edit intact; accepting the prompt navigated to BACK-543; a plain anchor to another task was blocked the same way while a same-page hash anchor was allowed without prompting. Re-rendered BACK-593 afterwards to confirm the wider candidate pattern still links only real IDs.

Review round 2 (PR #865, two accepted, two deferred):

Accepted 1 (P1). The navigation guard predicate leaned on isDirty, which tracks only the long-form fields, so a comment draft or create-mode metadata could be lost silently. Unsaved work now also counts the comment draft fields, and in create mode any entered field at all (title, type, priority, milestone, assignees, labels, dependencies, references), since nothing is persisted while creating. Two new tests cover a comment-only draft and create-mode metadata entered before any title.
Accepted 2 (P2). Backslash joined the preceding path-boundary characters, so backlog\tasks\BACK-123 - Title.md no longer linkifies the embedded ID, matching the forward-slash rejection. One test covers the Windows-style path.

Deferred to BACK-599 (bug, web, low, depends on BACK-260): (a) the identity index covers only the active tasks from /api/search while route resolution covers active plus completed, so completed-task references stay unlinked and an active BACK-1 can link while a completed BACK-01 makes the route ambiguous; the real fix needs the parked BACK-260 decision about completed tasks in the web corpus first. (b) generated task links drop search params and taskModalFrom state, so closing a task opened from a filtered board or list returns to an unfiltered view; App.handleEditTask is the precedent to reuse.

Round 2 verification: 17 tests in src/test/mermaid-markdown.test.tsx, 4 in src/test/web-dependency-input-links.test.tsx, 6 in src/test/web-task-details-modal-unsaved-navigation.test.tsx (adding the comment-only draft and create-mode metadata-only scenarios). Full suite 1968 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail across 216 files; bunx tsc --noEmit and bun run check . clean.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Took over PR #812 (David Cottrell, @cottrell): task IDs written in prose in the Web UI now render as links to /tasks/<id>, and dependency chips in the task details sidebar link to the task they reference. His two source commits were cherry-picked so his authorship stays in the history; the colliding back-555 task file was dropped.

Detection runs as a small remark plugin over the markdown AST (src/web/utils/task-id-links.ts) instead of a regex over the raw source, so inline code and fenced code blocks are excluded structurally and existing links keep their target. Candidates resolve against the task corpus the Web UI already loads, through a TaskIdIndexProvider fed by App state, so UTF-8, ISO-8601, v1.2.3 and unknown IDs never link; canonical collisions and ID-shaped tails of longer identifiers stay plain. Dependency chips resolve through that same canonical identity, so case and zero-padding differences still link and ambiguous IDs do not.

Because these links leave the open task, TaskDetailsModal now confirms before any in-modal link navigates away from unsaved edits, covering both the react-router chips and the plain markdown anchors; same-page anchors and new-tab clicks are exempt.

Verified with 24 tests across three web component test files, the full suite (1965 pass, 5 skip, 0 fail), tsc and biome clean, and live browser passes: prose IDs linked while fenced and inline code stayed plain, an auto-link opened the target task, a dependency chip navigated between tasks, and the unsaved-edit prompt blocked and then allowed navigation as chosen.
