## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Follow-up from the PR #898 (BACK-623) review. task archive, task complete, and task demote still resolve their target through the default cross-branch loadTaskById (src/cli.ts around the archive/complete/demote handlers), so they pay the full corpus load and attempt a remote fetch that view/edit/list no longer do, and they surface different errors for branch-only tasks (archive: 'Cannot archive task from another branch'; view: not found). Per the owner ruling that CLI task commands are local-only, align these three commands with the local active+completed resolution used by view/edit, including the fail-closed local ambiguity behavior and the branch-aware not-found hint. Not part of the v1.50.x hotfix release.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 task archive, task complete, and task demote resolve targets through the shared local resolution used by task view and task edit
- [x] #2 None of the three commands triggers a remote fetch or cross-branch corpus load (fetch-tripwire test)
- [x] #3 Branch-only targets produce the same local not-found error and hint as task view
- [x] #4 Local fail-closed ambiguity (AmbiguousTaskIdError) is preserved for all three commands
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Route task archive, complete, and demote through the working-copy active/completed resolver for both CLI preflight and Core mutation.
2. Extend local task command tests for fetch tripwires, branch-only not-found hints, and active/completed ID ambiguity across all three lifecycle commands.
3. Run the focused suite, typecheck, formatting/lint checks, and the relevant full test suite; then finalize BACK-626 with objective evidence.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Kept existing Core callers backward-compatible by adding an optional third TaskReadOptions argument; only the CLI lifecycle handlers request working-copy-only resolution.
Validation: focused local task test 9/9; lifecycle/Core/MCP scoped suite 142/142; TypeScript, Biome, build, and git diff checks passed. Independent review found P0=0/P1=0.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Made task archive, complete, and demote local-first at both CLI preflight and mutation boundaries. Branch-only targets now match view/edit guidance, remote/corpus loading is tripwired out, and local ID ambiguity remains fail-closed.
