## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
TUI board handlers construct Core(process.cwd()) directly at multiple sites in src/ui/board.ts (file:line evidence in the BACK-581 review notes), bypassing resolveRuntimeCwd and BACKLOG_CWD. This is the same divergence family as issue #854 (init ignoring BACKLOG_CWD). Direction from Alex (2026-08-08): all interfaces must go through the same core logic; no interface builds its own Core from process.cwd(). Audit the TUI (and any other interface) for remaining direct Core(process.cwd()) construction and route everything through the shared instance or the shared runtime cwd resolver.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 No TUI code constructs Core from process.cwd() directly; all handlers reuse the shared core instance or the shared runtime cwd resolver
- [x] #2 TUI operations honor BACKLOG_CWD end to end
- [x] #3 A repo-wide audit confirms no other interface constructs Core from process.cwd() outside the shared resolver, or aligns the stragglers
- [x] #4 Tests or recorded verification evidence cover the BACKLOG_CWD path in the TUI
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add one shared runtime-core factory next to Core: `createRuntimeCore(options?)` in src/core/backlog.ts, which builds a Core from `resolveRuntimeCwd()` (honours --cwd/BACKLOG_CWD, else process.cwd()). Single resolution path for every surface.
2. Thread the already-constructed Core into the board TUI: add `core?: Core` to renderBoardTui options; unified-view.ts, simple-unified-view.ts and enhanced-views.ts pass their existing `options.core`. Inside board.ts replace all 7 `new Core(process.cwd(), { enableWatchers: true })` sites (create, edit, complete x2, archive x2, reorder) with one closure that returns the passed instance, falling back to a memoised createRuntimeCore() only when no instance was supplied (tests call renderBoardTui directly).
3. Remove the remaining TUI cwd construction: src/ui/enhanced-views.ts uses the threaded core instead of `new Core(process.cwd())`; src/ui/task-viewer-with-search.ts fallback uses createRuntimeCore instead of `new Core(process.cwd(), ...)`.
4. Align non-TUI stragglers on the same factory: src/utils/task-path.ts (getTaskPath fallback), src/utils/status.ts (getValidStatuses fallback), src/completions/data-providers.ts (shell completion data). Audit and record the rest: web server (Core built from requireProjectRoot in cli.ts) and MCP (resolveRuntimeCwd in commands/mcp.ts) are already resolver-based; src/server/index.ts process.cwd() is asset-dir chdir bookkeeping, src/readme.ts writes README relative to process.cwd() (output path, not project resolution).
5. Tests: unit-test createRuntimeCore honouring BACKLOG_CWD and falling back to process.cwd(); TUI test that presses 'n' with a stub composer that calls the default `persist`, once with BACKLOG_CWD pointing at a fixture (task lands in the fixture while process.cwd() is elsewhere) and once with an explicit core for a second fixture (task lands there, proving the passed instance is reused).
6. Verify: grep -rn "Core(process.cwd" src/ is empty, bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run test.

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation

Added one shared resolution path and threaded the existing Core through the TUI.

- `createRuntimeCore(options?)` (src/core/backlog.ts, exported next to `Core`) builds a Core from `resolveRuntimeCwd()`, so `--cwd`/`BACKLOG_CWD` (else `process.cwd()`) is honoured in exactly one place. It fails closed when the override points at a missing directory, matching the CLI entry points.
- src/ui/board.ts: `renderBoardTui` takes `core?: Core` and all seven handlers (create, edit, complete x2, archive x2, reorder) now call a single `getCore()` closure that returns the caller's instance, memoising a `createRuntimeCore({ enableWatchers: true })` fallback only when no instance was supplied (tests call renderBoardTui directly). Previously each handler built `new Core(process.cwd(), { enableWatchers: true })`.
- src/ui/unified-view.ts, src/ui/simple-unified-view.ts and src/ui/enhanced-views.ts pass the Core they already hold; enhanced-views no longer builds its own from `process.cwd()`.
- src/ui/task-viewer-with-search.ts fallback uses `createRuntimeCore` instead of `new Core(process.cwd(), ...)`.

Notable side effect of threading the instance: the board previously bound mutations to `process.cwd()` while rendering from the project root resolved by `requireProjectRoot()`. That diverged not only under BACKLOG_CWD but also whenever the TUI was launched from a subdirectory. Board mutations now share the Core the task viewer already used, so all TUI surfaces read one project root and the board stops creating throwaway watcher-enabled Cores per keypress.

## Interface audit (repo-wide)

Aligned on the shared resolver:
- src/utils/task-path.ts `getTaskPath` optional-core fallback.
- src/utils/status.ts `getValidStatuses` optional-core fallback.
- src/completions/data-providers.ts shell-completion data provider (dropped its local `createCore`).

Already resolver-based, unchanged:
- Web server: `new BacklogServer(cwd)` at src/cli.ts:5230 with `cwd` from `requireProjectRoot()` -> `requireRuntimeCwd()` -> `resolveRuntimeCwd()`.
- MCP: `createMcpServer(runtimeCwd.cwd)` from src/commands/mcp.ts, which calls `resolveRuntimeCwd({ cwd: options.cwd })`.
- Every `new Core(cwd)` in src/cli.ts takes `cwd` from `requireProjectRoot()`/`requireRuntimeCwd()`.

Remaining `process.cwd()` uses that are not project resolution and were left alone:
- src/server/index.ts:483 saves/restores the process cwd around the bundled-asset `chdir`; it never builds a Core.
- src/readme.ts writes README.md and a temp board file relative to `process.cwd()` (output path, a separate concern from project resolution).
- src/commands/help-schema.ts:183 resolves an output directory override for schema generation.

## Verification

- `grep -rn "Core(process.cwd" src/` -> no matches (exit 1).
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` clean; `bun run check .` clean (367 files); `bun run test` -> 2065 pass, 6 skip, 0 fail across 223 files.
- New src/test/tui-runtime-cwd.test.ts drives the board's `n` handler through its own `persist` with process.cwd() pointed at an unrelated directory: one case asserts the task lands in BACKLOG_CWD, the other asserts a supplied Core instance wins over BACKLOG_CWD. Both fail against the pre-change board.ts (`Expected length: 1 / Received length: 0`) and pass after.
- src/test/runtime-cwd.test.ts covers `createRuntimeCore` for the process.cwd() default, the BACKLOG_CWD override, and the invalid-override rejection.
- PTY verification of a real mutation: cwd = this repo worktree (a different Backlog project), BACKLOG_CWD = a /tmp fixture project holding one task. `expect` spawned `bun src/cli.ts board`, the window title rendered as "Fixture Project - Board" with the fixture's TASK-1, then `a` + Enter produced the "Archived TASK-1" footer and moved `backlog/tasks/task-1 - Second-fixture-task.md` into the fixture's `backlog/archive/tasks/`. The same script against the pre-change board.ts timed out waiting for the footer and left the file in `backlog/tasks/`.

## Review follow-up (Codex P2 on PR #876, thread src/core/backlog.ts:3306)

`createRuntimeCore` used `resolveRuntimeCwd()` verbatim, but the CLI goes `requireProjectRoot()` -> `findBacklogRoot()`, which ascends from the resolved directory to the actual project root. So when BACKLOG_CWD (or the shell cwd, for fallback callers) pointed at a *subdirectory* of a valid project, the factory targeted `<subdir>/backlog`, which does not exist: shell completions silently returned empty task/label/assignee lists while CLI commands on the same environment worked. That is the same cross-interface divergence this task exists to remove, so it was fixed here rather than deferred.

Fix: `createRuntimeCore` now resolves the runtime cwd and then walks up with the existing `findBacklogRoot`, mirroring `requireProjectRoot`.

Not-found semantics: when `findBacklogRoot` returns null the factory keeps the resolved directory as the project root (`(await findBacklogRoot(cwd)) ?? cwd`) instead of exiting the way `requireProjectRoot` does. That preserves the exact pre-change behaviour of every caller — these are optional-core fallbacks in library code, not CLI entry points, so completions must degrade to their static fallbacks and never crash the shell. An invalid BACKLOG_CWD still rejects from `resolveRuntimeCwd` (fail closed), which `withCore` swallows into the static fallback. No semantics fork: exiting the process was never an option for these call sites.

Coverage added to src/test/runtime-cwd.test.ts: BACKLOG_CWD at a nested subdirectory resolves to the parent project root; the same via process.cwd(); no-project stays on the resolved directory; and completion providers (`getTaskIds`/`getLabels`/`getAssignees`) read the parent project from a subdirectory plus two graceful-degradation cases. The three subdirectory assertions fail without the ascent, reproducing Codex's empty-`getTaskIds()` finding.

CLI-level confirmation with BACKLOG_CWD pointing at `<fixture>/packages/cli` inside an initialized fixture project:
- after: `bun src/cli.ts completion __complete "backlog task view " 18` -> `TASK-1`, `--plain`, `--json`
- before: same command -> `--plain`, `--json` only (task ID missing)

Re-verified: `bunx tsc --noEmit` clean, `bun run check .` clean (367 files), `bun run test` -> 2071 pass, 6 skip, 0 fail (2077 tests, 223 files).

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Routed every TUI mutation through the Core instance its caller already holds, with a single `createRuntimeCore()` factory as the only remaining construction path: it resolves the runtime working directory (--cwd/BACKLOG_CWD, else process.cwd()) and then ascends to the project root via findBacklogRoot, mirroring the CLI's requireProjectRoot; when no project is found it keeps the resolved directory so optional-core fallbacks (notably shell completions) degrade gracefully instead of exiting. All seven board.ts handlers, enhanced-views and the task-viewer fallback no longer build `new Core(process.cwd())`; the same factory covers the getTaskPath/getValidStatuses fallbacks and the completion data providers. Web server and MCP were already resolver-based and unchanged. Verified with `grep -rn 'Core(process.cwd' src/` (no matches), new src/test/tui-runtime-cwd.test.ts and createRuntimeCore/completion cases in src/test/runtime-cwd.test.ts (each new assertion confirmed failing against the pre-change code), a PTY run where BACKLOG_CWD archived a fixture task while cwd sat in a different Backlog project, a CLI completion run resolving TASK-1 from a project subdirectory, and clean bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run check ., bun run test (2071 pass / 6 skip / 0 fail).
